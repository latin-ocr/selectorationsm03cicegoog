was necessary that he should be adopted into a plebeian family· Repented
attempta were made by the tribune, C. Herennius, to get this brought about
But the triumvirs had not yet talren Clodius’s side. Cicero, however, whose
reliance was placed on the friendship and support of Pompey, in defending
C. Antonius, provolred the triumvirs, and especially Cmar, and within three
hours after the delivery of his speech, Clodius becanm the adopted son of Ρ.
Fonteius (at the end of the year ost). The lex curiata t'or bis adoption was
proposed by Cesar, and Pompey presided in the assembly. The whole pro·
ceeding was irregular, but Clodius was soon actively endeavoring to moure bis
election to the tribuneshlp, and succeeded in his object with the watenes of
Caesar, and entered upon his office in December, a. u. c. tot.

Clodius did rrot immediately assail his enemies llis first messores werea
series of lawa, calculated to lay senate, knights, and peeple under obligations
to him. The consuls of the year he also gained ever to his interestis, and hev-
ing thus prepared the wey, he opened his attach upon Cicero by proposiug a
law to the effect, that whoever had talren the life of a citizen, uncondemned
and without a trial, should be interdicted from earth and water. The pro·
ceedings which ensued ended in Cicero’s withdrawing inte exile.

Immediately after the banishment of Cicero, Clodius set sire to his house on
the Palatine, and destroyed his villas at 'llrsculnm and Formiae. The greater
partos the property carried off from thern, was divided between the two con·
sula To alienate Cicero’s property irretrievably, he dedicated it to the god-
dess Libertas; and a small portion of the site os the dwelling on the Palatina,
with part oi the mound on which the portico of Catulus, which adioined Ci-
cem's grounds, had seed, was occupied by a chapel to the goddess lle went
sofar as to offend Pompey by aiding the escape ol tigranes, son os the lring of
Armenia, whom Pompsy had brought aprisoner to Rome. In this instance
also his services were purchased. Pompey, however, did not feel himself
strong enough to resent the insnlt Clodius soon assailed him more openly,
and made an attempt, through one os his slaves, upon the life of Pompey, who
now withdraw to bis own house, and lrept there as long as his enemy was in
office.

The attempta madsbefore theend of this year to procura the recall of Cicero
proved abortire. Next year, a. u. c. 697, T. Annius Milo was tribune of the
plebs, when his memorable and fatal contest with Clodius began. Milo was
deeply in debt, and a wealthy province alone could extricata him. But with·
out eloquence or political talant, the member of a comparatively obscure fam·
ily could not hope to obtain the consulate, unless he identified his own interest
with that of scine one or other of the great leaders of the commonwealth,
Milo, therefore, attached himself to Cn. Pompey, and Cicero’s recall from exile
was the immediate pretext of their alliance. ln procuring Cicero’s restoration,
Milo, thom his daring and unscrupulous character, was by far the most effi·
cient of the tribunes. He combated Clodius with his own weapons He pur-
chased,aster a faint and fruitless trial of constitutional mea s, a band of gle-
dIators, and the streets of Rome were the scene of almost laoy and always
deadly conflicta between the two leaders of these paid amassins.

When the senate came to a resolution to propose to the comitia a decrce for ⁶

the restoration of Cicero, Clodius was the only orte who opposed it; and when,
on the fourth of August, it was brought before the people, Clodius spolre
against it, bnt could do nothing mora The decree by which Cicero was re-
called, provided also for the restitution of his pmperty. Some difficulty, how·
ever, remainsd with respect to the house on the Palatina, the sito of which
had been consecrated by Clodius to the service of religion. The matter was
referred to the college of pontifices, who returned an answer sufficient to sat-
isfy all religions scruples; and the senate decreed the restoration of the site,
