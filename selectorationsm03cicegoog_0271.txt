'lheoration for Marcellus was epolren in the senate, e. u. c. tum and wne
the first which Cicero delivered atter the downfall of the republic. Aesubse·
queutly written out aud published, it was always admired ae a finished die·
course. ‘⁶ Cicere,’' says Middleton, “touched by the generoeityof Cesar,
and greatly pleeeed with the act itself, ou the account of his friend, returned
thanis to him in a speech, which, though made upon the spot, yet for ele-
gance of diction, vivacity oi sentiment, and politenees of compliment, iesupe-
rior to any thing emant of the lrind in all antiquity.” ithae been regarded us
the model of Pliny’e Panegyricos Traiam and pamagee from it are quoted
and explained by Nonius Marcellus, Lactantius, and Priscian, as well ee in
the fragments of Commentadee on Cicero’s Oratione, which have come down
ιο ue under the name of Asconim Pedianus

Notwithetanding thir, it ie maintained by F. A. Wolf, that Cicero delivered ,

no oration for Marcellus, still lem that he wrote one out; and, consequently,
uiae the present watien ie a declamatory exercise of a later period, perhaps of
the age of Tiberius, shortly before Asconius. This view was eesailed by
Worrn,1(alau, and Weiske, but defended by Spalding, until at a later date
Jacob reexamined the whole question, and cameto the conclusion that, in

accordance with the testimony of the enciente, Cicero delivered end wrote ,

outaspeech lor Marcellus, and thatthis speech cen ba, ina great measure,
recognieed in the oration which has come down to ue, but that it hes received
later additione and interpolatione. This view was received with much favor
by Pmsow and Hand. ludependently of Jacob, Hug also, and aiter him Sa·
vele, who gave prominence ιο the testimony of Cicero himself, endeevored
to set aeide the doubts respecting the muninenesr of the present oration,

· which Schiitz, and aller him Orelli, who alec directed attention ιο earlier

doubts of'a Spaniard, John Andros, again condemned as spurious, though
euch aseutence, even allowing single interpolatione, as also numerous varia·
tiens of MSS. from each other, on the whole, can hardly be justified or rest on
a eure and satisfactory basis, in opposition to the external evidence oi the au·
thorities already noticed, or ιο the finishcd style and composition of thie ora·
tion. Some oid scholia on this oration, which, although not written by Aeco-
niue in their present form, are yet not later than the eth century, have been
discovered by Angelo Mai. Among later assertore and defendere of the au·
thenticity oi the oration for Marcellus, may be mentioned Steinmetz, Dru·
mann, R. Klotz, and suere.
