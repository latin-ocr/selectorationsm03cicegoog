{¹2⁰3 cipal object io the oration. Il this question was put in the torhue of

the slaves oi Clodius, they were eubjected to tortura against their mas-
tar, and: de aereis nulla lege qaeestio eat io dominam nisi de incestu.

18. Nunc, with emphasis= nuuc demum, 100 days after the Χ
death of Clodius See §llll-Inatrio Litertotia There wasa tem·
ple of libertas on the Aventius, built by the father of the Gracchi.
There was also au atrium Libertatis by tholorum, ad Ate. 4, 16, 14.
When Clodius had driven Cicero into exile, he destroyed his house on
the Palatina, and on its sita had erected a chapel to Libertas 'Phe
spacious perches oi templee were used for various purposes; and per·

, haps business, particularly that relating to slaves and ireedmen, was
trausacted in the Atrium Libertatis. Klotz supposes the atrium Li·
lrertatia is mentioned as the place ol tho examination, in order to sug·
gest the hope ot heedom as an inducement to the slaves to give the
dasired answars.

19. Quibusnam de servis. When Appius could not procura
the slaves of Milo sor examination‚ he had recourse to those of Ρ. Glo-
dius Cicero shows the tairnass that may be expected from slaves
drilled by the accersor—Rogas? A familiar formula ol every-day
conversation aod dialogus, frequently used when one issurprised‚ or
affects surprise, that the other could ask.

20. auis . . . Appius. This is an instance os the rhetorical fig-
ure carisi mmm mamm compressa Quinctilii, ³, 31, artos ιι a
an example. Z. 821. Appius was the uephew ol Publius Clodius.

21. Ab Appio = ex Appii domo. How little credit would be due
to their declaratione, appears from Flooe. 10. .

22. Qirmtto cst, like aetio eet = tha right, doc„ emma-In do·
minum. Klotz: in dominos. ⁸

23. Proxtme deos accessit clodius. Because he is put on a
par with them iu the mode ot examination touchiug his death. Tho
violatiou ol their mysteries demands the inquisition. The death of
Clodius has called lor tha same. This is a nearer approach to divin-
ity thau was even his famous adventure at Caeam house. In this
signification, accedere od, commonly with prope, propios, proxime, is
tho usual construction in Cicero. He also usesthedative. Compare
Arnold's Nepos, Tltem 4, l, and 7, 2. See also Ζ. 386 and 387.
What double meaning iu this sentence? hig. 12, ³7: homines enim
od deos nullo re propios accedant quom sulutem hominibus dando.
Robir. perd. 2, 5: Deinde voe,Quiritea, qaorum potestas proxime ad
deorum immortalium numen accedit. ”

25. Sed tamen, doc. Were the slaves ot Milo examined against
Milo, the trulh might easily be elicited; for it was not the difficulty of
arriving at the truth, but the indignity of the proceeding that dictated
the rejection ol such testimony 3 but where the slaves ol the accuser
are questioned against the arraiguad, ol Appios against Milo, is truth
