THE ORATION FOR Q. fruamus

INTRODUC'I'ION.

Lrarsrus was the name of three brothers, who lived iu the time of the civil
wers between Ceasar and Pompey. They were of Sabine origin.

Q. Ligarius is first mentioned in r. c. c. 704 as legate, in Africa, of C. Con·
sidius Longus, who left him in command of the province, while he went to
Rome to become a candidate for the consulship.

On the breaking out of the civil war in the following year, L. Atius Varus,
who had commanded the Pompeian troops st Auximum, and had besu obliged
to ily before Coear, arrived irr Africa, of which province he had been formerly
propraetor. Into his hands Ligarius resigned the governmeut, although L.
AElius Tubero had been appointed to the province by the senate; and when
Tubero made his appearance otf Utica shortly afterwards, he was not permit-
ted even to land. Ligarius fought under Varus against Curio in the course of
the same year (r. u. e. 7⁰5), and against Crssar himself in 7⁰8. After the bat-

, tle of Thapsus, in which the Pompeian army was defeated, Ligarius was ta·

lren prisoner at Adrumetum. llis life was sperari, but he was banished by
Cesar. His friends at llorne exerted themselves to procura his pardon, but
were unable to suoceed at tlrst,notwithstanding the intercessieu of his brothers,
of his uncle, T. Brocchus, and of Cicero himself, who had an audieuce with
the dictator on the 2³d of September, r. u. c. 708, for the purpose. Meantime,
a public accusation was brought against Ligarius by Q. AElius Tubero, the
son of L Tubero, whom Ligarius had united with Varus in preventing from
lauding irr Africa lie was accrusd orr account of his conduct in Africa, and
his connection with the enemies of the dictator. The case was pleaded bo·
fore Ceasar himself iu the forum. Cicero defended Ligarius in the following
speech, in which he maintains that Ligarius had as much claim to the mercy
of Caesar as Tubero and Cicero himself. Ligarius was pardonsd by Coesar, who
was on the point of setting out for the Spanish war, arrd who probably was not
sorry to have this public opportunity of exhibiting his usual mercy. The
speech which Cicero delivered ln his defence has been much admired. Liga-
rius, however, felt no gratitudo for the favor that had been shown him, arrd
eagerly joined the conspirators, who minares Coesar in r. o. c. tro.
Appiae spealrs of two brothers of the name of Ligarius, who perished irr the

. proscriptien of the triumviro in s. u. c. 711 (B. 0. iv. tu); arrd in the following
chapter, he mentions a third Ligarius, who met with the same fate. Now, as
Cicero expressly mentions three brothers of this name, Q. Ligarius must have
been one of those who were put to death on this oceanea. Diei. G. ond R.
