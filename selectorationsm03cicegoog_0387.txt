eth. From his hopes of impunity.

And the evidence, upon which these circumstances are alleged, are the words
² and actions ot the deceased.

The conclusion ot the whole is, Milo acted in seli-deience, and Clodius was

lawtuuy killed.

2. Timere· See p. Deion 1, 1, and the references there guen.
Much oi this kind oi language we may regard as mere rhetorical art.
ln the present instance there was real cause ior sear, and real sear. For
the tribunes had held hostile meetings against Milo, and had endeavored
to excite the people against Cicero too, ior so warmly undertaking the
defense oi Milo 3 and so far succeeded‚ that not only Milo but Cicero
also was hated by the greatest part oi the populace. The unusual
preparatione too, to prevent disturbando, added to his aiarm. When
Cicero began to speak the partinens oi Clodius commencod a threaton-
ing outcry, sor the purpose oi intimidating him, and could not be re-

ὅ. Novi iudicii. The trial oi Milo was extraordinary, by a spo·
cisi commission, instead oi before the estkblished tribunale Pompey,
on being appointed consul without a colleague, issued an edict that
no one should carry any weapon in the city, and in a few days pro·
posed now projecte oi law in the senate, two oi which, aiter a dccreo
of the senate, he promulgated to the people. One law was de vi,
and expressiy comprehended tho murder which had been perpetra·
ted on the Appian road, the burning oi the curia, and the assault
upon the house oi the interrex Μ. Lepidus. The other iaw was
de ambitu. These lawe heightened the punishment, and abridged
the judicial process. They limited the taking oi the testimony to
three days, confined the speeches of the accuser and the accused to
one and the same day, allowing the former two, the latter three
honre. For the trial oi Milo, Pompey carried through a bill, that

» the people should choose a quaesitor irem the number oi the cossu-
lares. L. Domitius Ahenobarbus was chosen. Aiso the other judices
appointed by Pompey were oi such a character, that there was but
one voice, that never had more eminenter more couscientious men
been appointed judges.-Nooa sermo. The shops were shut through·
out the whole city, soldiers posted in the sorum, and at all the entran-
ces to the iorum, and Pompey with a select guard took his station be·
sore the serarium. When Cicero began to spaek, the Clodian iaction
set up an outcry and clamor. They were not even deterrsd hythe
