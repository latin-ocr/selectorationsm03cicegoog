FIRST ORATION AGAINST CATILINE.

ANALYSIS.

This oration is distributed into three parts :-

1. 1u the introduction the orator expresses his astonishment at the hold ap·
pearance oi catiline in the senate, and reminds hini with what severity he
ought long before to heve been treated, assimiler cases were dealt with in
earlier periodsoi the state.¹ lie nt the same time gives the reasons, tor
which he has not already put Catilius to death. (chaps. 1,ι,)

t. The main proposition isa summoue ιο catilina ιο leave the city, to go
eitherium exile or into the oarnp oi Mallius (ch. ³) ; ior-

(ο) ilis shameiui conspiracy is known matthie privare life stained hy crimes
of every kind, and his public life has to such a degree excited the ahhorrence
nithe sonate, the citizens, and the whole country, that it hy an emphatic
silence, enituere, demands the removal oi Catiline, although the erinsul
by allowing him to go nnpunished will bring upon himself the greatest
odium. (Chaps. t-st y 2³.)

(h) lt must he agreeahle to Catilina himself to leave Rome and withdraw to ¹
the camp oi Mallius. whither he has already sent forwerd his troops, finding
as he does, consistently with his character, his greatest delight in making
arar upon his country, and in the society oi similar disturhers oi the public ·
peace. (Ch. 9, y 24, ιο ch. 1⁰.) And.

(e) Such swithdrawal oi Catiline will he more advantageous to the state
thau would he his execution, ss in the former cese his fellowoonspirators
will follow him, and thns the seeds oi disorder he extirpated This last
consideration the orator adds especially asa justification oi his course oi
proceeding. (cuaps. 11-13, yth)

3. In conclusion, Cicero promises to the senate the cooperation oi all orders
in suppressing the remnants ottho conspiracy, atter the removal oi Catiline
and hia associatae, ond, again hidding Catiline with his adherente ιο leave

‚Rome he supplicares Jupiter Stator ιο protect and sare the Roman state
(ch. 13, y tlt-end.)
