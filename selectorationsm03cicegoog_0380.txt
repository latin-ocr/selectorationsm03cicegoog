INTRODUCTION.

P. cmnme Pumrrrn tirst makes his appearance in history in a. u. cadet,
serving with his brother Appius under his brother-inlaw, L. Lucullus, in Asia
Displeased at not being treated by Lucullus with the distinction he had ex-
pected. he encouraged the soldiers to mutiny. hl'terwards, being intrusted by
his other brother-inlaw, Q. Marcius Rex, at that time proconsul in Cilicia,
with the command ol the lieet, he loll into the hands ol the pirates, who how-
ever dinnimed him without ransom, through sear os Pompey. He next went
to Antiocheia, and joined the syriane in making war on the Arabians. Here
again he excited some ol the soldiers to mutiny, and nearly lost his lile. He
now returned to Rome, and made his first appearance in civil affairs in s. u. o.
689, by impeaching Catiline lor extortion in his governmentol Africa Catilina
bribed his accuser end judae, and escaped.

ln a. u. c. ooo, Clodius accompsnied the propretor, L. Murena, to Gallia
imnmlpim, where he resoned to the most nelarious methods ol procuring
money. He also had recourse to similar proceedings on his return to Rome.

Towards the close ol ost, Clodius was guilty ol an act ol sacrilege, which is
especially memoreble, as it gave rise to that deadly enmity between himself
and Cicero, which produced such important consequences to both end to
Rome. The mysteries ol the Bona Dea were this yenr celebrated in the house
ol Coesar. Clodius, who had an intrigue with Pompeia, Csasar’s wile, with the
assistance of one ol the attendants entered tlre house disgrused as a female
musician. But while his gulde was gone to apprize her mistress, Clodius was
detected by bis voice. The alarin was immediately given, but he medellis
escape hythe aid ol the damsel who had introduced him. He was already a
candidate lor the quasstorship, and was elected; but in the beginning ol tot,
before he set out lor his province, he was impeached lor this offence. The
senate referred the matter to the pontifices, who declared itan act ol impiety.
Under the direction ol the senate a rogation was proposed to the people, to the
effect that Clodius should be tried by judices selected by the pictor who was
to preside. 'she assembly, however, was brolren up without coming to a da·
cision ‘l'he senate was at first disposed to persist in its original plain but al·
terwnrds, on the recommendation ot' Hortensius, the proposition ol the ¹h‘ibune
Fufius Calenus was adopted, in accordance with which the judices were to be
selected from the three decurias. Cicero, who had hitherto strenuously sup·
ported tlresenate, now relaxed in his exertions Clodius attempted to prove
an alibi, but Cicero’s evidence shewed that he was with him in Rome only
three heure before he pretended to have been at Interamna Bribery and in-
timidation‚ however. secured him an acquittal by a majority os 31 to 25. Ci-
cero, however, who had been irritated by some sarcastic cllusions made by
Clodius to his consulship, and by a verdict given in contradiction to his iesti-
mony, atteclred Clodius and his pantheus in the senate with great vehemenca
