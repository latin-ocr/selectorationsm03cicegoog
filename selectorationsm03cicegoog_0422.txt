11. α. Amas, meus amlous. Some consider meus amicus as
said with bitter irony. But Cicero, in Vatia 12, 30, calls Q. Arrius
familiaris meur, and od Q. scat. 1, 3, 8, when compluiningof him
and Hortensius, indicates friendly relations with him. Amuur meur,
familiaris meus, eir fortissimus, and the like, are rather compli-
mentary additions, without their full meaning.

12. comperit. 'Phough Cicero asserts that Milo had no means
of knowing the return of Clodius from Aricia, yet, forargument’s sake,
hs admits that he might have bribed a slave of Clodius to inform him.
He then produces the testimony of Clodins’s witnesses, to prove that
no such information could have been given3 his (Clodius's) return to
Rome being conunry to his intention, and owing to a circumstance
that it was impossible to feresca-Legite testimonio. 'l'he testimony

is quoting him to make out a point for himself, viz. that the return of
Clodius being occidental, could not have been known by Milo. But it
is enough for bis present purpose, that his opponente admit the truth
of the testimonias by which be convicta thern of charging himself and
Milo falsely. He afterwards shows that the evidence was false, and
this remark on Cassinius leads the heurer to expect as much. ⁶
