31. Ipsius belli, i. e. without regarding the good os the cause&
But Benecke takes it as = ejus ipsius, Cicero having already spoken
os Castor's zeal in the cause os Pompay. In this case ipre commonly
stands before its substantive3 and if Cicero had spoken ol war in gen·
eral, he would have said belli ipsias. Madvig reads illias.

³2. Felix lata domas. Cicero compares the iomanes os the
two familias, in order to excite odium against the oue, and pity to·
words the other. They were both in Pharsalia Mark the conse·
qnence. Castor isnot only restomd to Goesar's lavor, hut permitted
to accuse others. Deiotarus is allowed to he arraigned by one who
was iu Pharsalia as well as he, who is his own grandson, and bosora
Cesar, at once the injured party arrd tha jndge.

33. Calamitosus Deletarus. The tshows that thepessage is
doubtful. Benecke froas-me MSS. gives qai et ab ea, which Hand,
Ture. 2, p. 521, approvss Recta sententia unice inest in ea, quern
olim proposui, conjectura: qui aaa modo ab eo, qui ia iisdem caetris
suerit, apud te, aad etiam a auia accusatur. Orelli.

86· Vos vestra· Vestra answers to the preceding ieta damae,
aud includes Castor and his father.

Cn. tlt-³8, Sint sane lnlmleitlae. Admit the existence of
enmity between the familias, which gratitudo and piety forbid, still
you might have entertained it like human hoinga, and not be thirsting
for blood like savage heasts.

42. Ingrata et impie. Ingrata alludes to the lavor, impie
the tie of relationship.

4³. Hominum more, i. e. in an open and honest manner; not
to prefer salse charges ; aot to seek to take away the lile, doc.

44. capitts ucessere. Z. 446, tat-Eam. It might be sup-
posed that Cicero having convicted Castor ol ingratituds and impieta,
should be obliged to stop there, as crimes so heiuous hardly admitted
ol amplification. But here his art appears iu seeming to accede all
this as trivial, that he may charge Castor with attempting to shake
th foundations of human society, and to declaro war against mankind.
Compare ch. 1, 3: aaa tam afflictam regiam coriditiouem dolebam,
quam de fortunia communibus extimescebam.
