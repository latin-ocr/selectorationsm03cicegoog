Cicero mught in the pomonal character ofthe accmed,and laid beforethe
judges, who could not well sacrifice the cause of learning and humanity ιο
such an accusation-such adefence could not mmnch urge the legal points at
lisiae, for which, as we have already observed, the documents were wanting,
as set forth the praise of varied acquirements, and of a life devoted to the cul-
tivation of the beautiful Audit isthisverypralse of the humaniora that
malres this speech auseful, agreeable, and inciting study to young readers;
though it must not be left unnoticed, that some critice consider it as spurious,
and unworthy of Cicero; and the ancients themselves regard it as less excel·
lent than other orations. Respectiag the result of the speech, which was da-
livered in Δ. u. c. ιιι. before Q„ Cicero, who was then prator urbanus, nothing
ishiovrn, and the remaining period of Archias’s life is buried in atter obscuri-
ty. 'l'ojudge from the few specimeus of his poetry which have come down

⁴ ιο us, it appears tliat hadid not postem so very great a poetical taleni as Cicero

describes it in hisorationi aad itis probable that Anchise, who was intimate
with so many Roman families, was inore particularly skilled in making verses
upon the passing events of the day, and also, assome believe, knew how to
male himself agraeable by improvisation, or extempore composition of verses.

ANALYSIS.

1. 'l'ss introduction gives the reason which decided the orator ιο defend the
post, and at the same dms conhins his apology for speaking of the advan-
tagss of letters in a trial at law. (Ghsps. l, t, t 3.)

2 The leading proposition states the two points of his defeace: that Archias,
who was already a Roman citizen, should not only not be deprived of his
franchise, but, even if he were not a citizen, the franchise should bs con·
ferred upon him. (chi, t t.)

. i. A description follows of the origin, acquired fame, and havelsof the poet;
showing, that, as he carne ιο Rome from these travelsin Asia lilinor, Greeca,
and Italy, the most distinguished men and families honored him with their
friendship and society, and that Lucullus sided him ιο obtain the Ιιοωοο
franchise. (i A-ch. t, i 7.)

t. t'iccro next proceeds ιο the two points of his defence. and refutes (a) the
grounds upon which the accuser had proceeded against Archias, and ssusb
lishea Archias‘s Roman citizenship, since hs had been acitizen in Heraclia,
an alllsd town, and accordingly hy the law of Silvanus and Carbo had been
received in Rome as acitizen, he having long before had a domicile in
Rome, and given in his name to the prator within oodays, and having more·
over exercised the rights of Roman citizens; attha same time the charge of
the maaser, that Archias was not enrolled in the census lists, is set aeide,
(te-cli. d.) (i) In order ιο show that Archias was worthy of Roman citi·
senshlp, he drst speaks of the advantages of letters, and especially of poet·
ry (cla ti, ι li-ch. 7, t lbi: he then describes the eminent poetic taleni of
Archias, and shows by examples how highly poets were esteerned hyan
tiquity; hethan enlarges upon the meritof Archias and his claime upon
the Roman people acquired by his celebratior in verse of the deeds of em-
inent Romans, aud hy his contribution in this way ιο the glory of the Ro
