ANALYSIS.

In this lucid end finished oration the orator commences with a modost recitet 01
the reasons which have hitherto presented him from addressing the people
ironi the rostra, testifies his gratitudo ior the office 01 prator conterred upon
him by tha people, and promises 101 devote the intluenoe 01 his office, and his
eloquence to the good 01 the state. (Ch. 1.) He then brietly reviews the con-
dition 01 the Romana in Asia Minor and the position oi Mithridates, which had
occasioned the Lex Manilia (14, 5), and distributos his speech into three
parts; the first 01 which treats 01 the character 01 thewar,tl1e second 01 the
magnitude, and the third 01 the general in whom are found the qualifications
requisito to bring it to a successful issue. (1 6.)

(1.) On the first head, the character 01 the war, the orator shows (a) that the
honor and dignity oi the Roman people are endangered (11-11); (1) that the
protectior] 01 the allies in Asia deserves the closest attention (111, 13) ; (cl that
the largest and surest ravenues 01 the state are exposed to the greatest danger, .
11 help is not speedily rendered (1 11-16) ; (d) that the property 01 many Roman
citizens, especially 01 the iarmers 01 the ravenue and 01 merchants, is depre-
ciated‚ so thatin Rome itsell the most disastrous consequences 10 the creditos
the state must ensue. (1 17, la)

(1.) cicero speaks 01 the greatncss and importance 01 the war, mentions with
due praise the manyand great victoriosos Lucullus (1111, sl). shows¹ however,
at the same time, how powerlul Mithridates has again become since his deteats,
(a) hy the aid 01 Tigranes and many nations 01 Asia; (1) hythe resistance 01
the army which has refused to follow its general ς (c) hythe return 01 Mithri-
dates 10 his kingdom, and the lrightlul overthrow which ha caused the Roman
army when Lucullus had been reoailed irom the command by tha Roman
people. (1111-20.)
