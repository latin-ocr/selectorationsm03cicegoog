the worhmen began their operatione iu November, Clodius attached and drove
thern off, pulled down the portico of Catulus, which had been nearly rebnilt,
and set tire to the house of Q. Cicero. Shortly atterwards he multer Cicero
himself in the street, and compelled him to take refuge in aneighbon'ng house.
Milo twice rescued him from the handsof the Clodian mob. ‘Ihe sicces of
the combatants was nearly moal. Milo’s honoee in Rome, the mana on
the Capitoline end another on the hill Germalm, were essailed by the Clo·
diane, but Clodius was twice driven from the forum, and the last time narrow·
ly escaped with his life. Nor did the rivale restrict their warfare to the swerds
of their adherente With equal justice and consistency they accrued each
other of a breach of the Lex Plotia de oi, and wilh equal violence both elu-
ded the results of prosecution. Clodius, however, notwithstanding lllilo’s re-
peated disruption ot' the comitia, succeeded in carrying his electiori forthe
curuleeedileship in s. u. c. tue, and was thus during his year of otlice exempt
from impeachrnent. Milo, whose tribunate expired in December, 697, was on
the other hand open to legal proceedings, and Cicero from dread of Crestus,
who favored Clodius, refused to undertake his defence. It was, therefore, ne-
cessary for his safety that he should again hold an office of the state. But his
banlrrupt condition did not allow him to risk the expensos of the curuleoedile-
ship, and there is no authentis record of his pretomhip. ln those convulsion-
ary years of Rome, it is indeed lilrely that the sequence of magistrocies was
not very strictly observed. Milo, however, although never aedile, exhibited
aedilitian gemes of unusual and, according to Cicero, of insane magnificence.
He was enabled to give them by the bequest of adeceased curule-aedile whose
name is lost, aad he exhibited them in the year previous to his cauves for the
consulship.

ln a, o. c.701‚ Milo was candidate for the consulship. and Clodius for the
pretoship of the ensuiug year. Each strove to hinder the election of the oth-
er. They collected ermed bande of slaves and gladiatore, and the streete of
Rome became the scene of fresh tumults and frays, in oneof which Cicero
himself was endangered. When the consuls endeavored to hold the comitia,
Clodius fell upon thern with his band, and one ol them, Cn. Domitius, was
wounded. The senate met to deliberate. Clodius spolie, and attached Cicero
and Milo, touching, among other things, upon the amount of debt with which
the latter was burdened. Cicero, to whom Milo’s election was of vital import-
ance, defended him in the speech De <ere alieno Milonis, of which a few frag·
ments are still extant. The contest, however, was soon aller brought to a
sudden and violent end. On the toth of ianuary, s. u. c. 702, ltlilo set out on
a journey to Lanuvium. Near Bovillae he met Clodius, who was reluming to
Rome aller visiting some of his property. Both were accompanied by armed
followers, but Milo’s party was the etronger. The two aritagonists hed passed
each other without disturbance; but two of the gladiatore in the rear of ltlilo’s
troop piched a quarrel with some of the followers of Clodius, who immediately
turned round and rode up to the scene of disputa, when he was wounded iu

, theshoulder by one of the gladiatore. 'lhe frey now became general. 'fhe

party of Clodius were put to fiight, aud betoolr themselves with their leader to
elrouse near Bovillae. Milo ordered his men to attach the house. Several of
Clodiue’s men were elain, and Clodius himself dragged out and dispatchetl.
The body was lelllying on the road, till a senator named Sex. Tedius louud it,
and conveyed it to Rome. Here it was exposed to the view os the populace, '
who crowded to see it. Next day it was carried naked to the forum, and
again exposed to view before the rostra. The mob, enraged by the spectacla,
and by the inflammatoryspeechesof the tribunes Munatius Plancus and Q.
Pompeius Rufus, headed by Sex. Clodius, cairied the corpse into the Cirris
