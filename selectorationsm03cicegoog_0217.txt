[Ahrens, Orelli, dec„ who attach the genuineness oi this oration, say
that Cicero was now Goneul, not a air consularis, i. e. one who had
been Consul. To thie Klotz replico, that with respect to his general
position in the stete, he was one ol those who had reached its highest
honor, the Consulship3 that it cie. had said “ to a Gonsul,” he would
both have nnnecessarily limited the nuth, and made it too immediately
applicahle to himself ; and that the concinnity oi the sentence requires
rather the adjective consularis then the substantive consul: . . . . viro
sorti . . . . consulari . . . . sapienti. He shows too that Cicero, in an·
other place, uses melaria oi Consule, as well as ol consulare, when
he speaks ol them as a clam e. g. Philipp. 5, §123 where, alter
mentioning several Consulens, he *adds D. Sileno L. Murenae, qni tom
erant Consules designati5 placuit idem, qood consularibus, Μ. Ga·
toni, dio, where even Consule elect are called consulares]
