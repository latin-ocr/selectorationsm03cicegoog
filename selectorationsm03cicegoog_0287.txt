sadeneiiecssemi. Thetext iu this passageis very corrupt Orelli
gives: sed, quio nou arietantibus omnibus necem dicere, u mecam

’ dici uolunt, cui neeesse eet quodum modo, qaod solatur et quodfieri
decet, et quod, M. Marcello ο te huic ordini, populoque Romano et rei
publice reddito, fieri id intelligo. Thisbe explains as follows: But
because it is uot necessary for all ιο rise and speak, they desire me to
do so, upon whom their wish imposes the obligation3 both because it
is proper in itself ιο give thanks now to you, end because it is M. Mar·
oellus, my friend, that has been restored by you, for whose restoration
1 now thanh you. With slight variations the commentext agrees with
the above from Orelli, except that el is given before quod volant, and
fieri omitted before decet ; and precipue ο me fieri debere, or praci-
pua id ο me fieri debere, or precipue ido me fieri, are found before
intelligo. But of precipue ο me aud debere there is no trace in
MSS. Steinmetz from MSS. gives the reading of Klotz, except that
after quodammode he retains iu brackets et quod colunt and et quod
before M. Marcello. He also indicates a lacuna before fieri iu intel-
ligo. They wieh me to speak, who am under a hind of necessity of
so doing, and who feel the propriety of it, since Marcellus has been
restored, dre.
