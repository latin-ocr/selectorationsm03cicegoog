prising the strong fortreae of Praeneste, which would have formed au admira·

more closely contined and preaesd by the net in which he was entaugled
tlrrough the activityof Cicero. Driven ιο despair by this accumulatiou of
disappointmeuts and dangers, he resolved at once ιο bring matters to a crisis,
and no longer ιο waste time by persevering in a course of polioy in which he
had been so repeatedly foiled. Accordingly, while he still endeavored ιο lreep
up appearances by lond protestatione of innocense, and by offeriug ιο place
himself under the control and surveillance of M. Lepidus3 of Q. Metellus, the
praetem or of Μ. Marcellus, in whose house he actually took up his abode; or
even of Cicero himself ; ou the night of the eth of November he met the ring·
leaders at thedwelling of Μ. Porcius mea, and atter complaining of their
baclrwardnemand inactivity, informed them thet he had dispatched Manlius
toEtruria, Septimius of Camerinum, toPicenum,C.JuliustoApulia, and others
of less note todifferent parts of ltsly ιο raise open war, and to organice ageneral
revolt of the slave population. lle added that he was desimus to place himself
at the head of his troops, but that ιι was absolutely necessary in tho first place
to remove Cicero, whose vigilance was mod injurious to their cause. Upon
this L. Vargunteius, a senator, and C. Comedus, a lmight, undertoolr ιο repair
at au early hour the following morning to the house of the consul, to malre
their way into his chamber as if for the purpose of paying their respacis, aud
then ιο stab him on the spot. 'lhe whole of these proceediugs were instantly
reported ιο their intended victim; the asmmins, when they presented them·
salves, were refused admimion, eud certain iutelligence having been now re·
ceived that the rebellion had actually broken out, on the enh of October, in
Etruria, Cicero, ou the ath of November, went down to tha senate, which, for
greater security, had been summoned to meet in the tem'ple of J upiter Stator,
aud there delivered his celebrated oration, “Quousque tandem abutere,
Catilina, patientia nostrnt’' which paralyzed the traitor, notso much hythe
vehemence of the invective, as by the intimate oequaintanoe which it dis·

every oue had shrunlr, rose ιο reply with downcast eounteuance. and in hum-
ble accentsimplored the fathers not ιο listen to the nralignant calumnias of
an upstart foreiguer against the noblest blood in Rome; but scarcely had he
commenced when his words were drowned by the shouts of ‘⁸ enemy'' and
‘⁸ parricide'' which burst from he whole assembly, and he rushed forth with
threats and curses ou his lips( on his return home, perceiving thet there was
now no hope of destroying his hated foe, and that the strict wetoh lrept
throughout the city rendered tumult and tire-raising difficult if not impossible
for the present, he resolved ιο strilre some decisivo blow before troops could
be levied to oppose him, and accordingly leaving the chief control of affairs at
Romaiu the handsof Lentulus arrd Cethegis, with the promise at thesemo
timeto march with all speed to their support ut the head of a powerful army,
set forth in thedoad of night (eth-eth November), and after remaining for a
few days with his adherente in the neighborhood of Arretium, where he as·
eumad the fasces aud other ensigns of lawfnl military command, proceeded
ιο the camp of Manlius, having previously addreased letters to the most dis·
tingeished consulere and others, solemnly protesting his insomnes, and ile-

clariug that, rmable to resist the cebet formed among his enemies, he had
determined to retire ιο Marseilles, that he might preserve bis country from
