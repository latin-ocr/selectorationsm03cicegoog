THE ORATION soit THE ΡΟΕΤ ARCHIAS.

fflTRODUGPION.

A. chmms Axomis, bom and educated at Antioch in Syria, a city re·
nowned for the cultivation of Grselr art and learning, amuired ata very early
agea considerable reputation as a poet He had scarcely grown out of the age
of boyhood, when, according to the fashion of the time, he went out on a jour·
ney‚ the object of which was to improve himself and increase his knowledge.
Ἴ He travelled through Asia Minor and Graece, and thence to Seuthem ltaly,
where be visited the towns of Tarentum, Locri, Rhegium, and Naples. llis
taleni was everywhere recognised aad apamenum, aud the above-mentioned
towns attested their estimation byhonon‘ng him with the franchise. ln a. u. c.
652, in the consulship of C. Marius sud Q. Lutatius Catulus, Archias came to
Rome; he was received into the first families of the city, and enjoyed the par·
ticular hospitality of the Luculli, iu honor of which family Archias also as
mmed its gentile name Licinius. As Cicero calls him his instmctor‚ it would
mern that Archias, besides his poetical occupatione, also engaged at that time
in instructing young Romans. Some years later he accompanied L. Lucullus
on ajoumey to Sicily, and on their return they passed through Heraclia in
Lucania There, too, he was, through the mediation of Lucullus, honored
with the franchise; and this was the more valuable to him, as that town was
in a nearly equal legal relation to, aud alhance with, Rome, and as Archias
saenis to have determined to spond the remainder of his life at Rome. ln
s. u. c. ulli, the tribunes, M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo, brought
forward a bill (lez Plautio Papirio) by which the franchise was conferrsd
upon all those who wera enrolled as citizens in an allied town, provided they
had adomicile in Italy at the time of the passing of tlie law, and gave iu their
name to the praetor within sixty days. Archias fultilled these conditious, and
gave iu his name for registration to the praetor Q. Metellus But iu a. u. c. 68⁹,
a law was pamcd (lez Papio), euecting that all peregrini, or strangam,
should be expelled from Rome, and that the Socii Latini (who were not Ro·
man citizens) should be sent away to their native places. On that occasion a
certain Gratius, who may have been iuduced by hatred, or avarica, or by eu-
mity against Lucullus, came forwerd, asserting that Archias was a peregri·
mra, aud had illegally assumed the name of a Roman citizen. Archias was
unable to bring forward any evidence of his franchise, for the archives of He
raclia had been destroyed by fire. During his long stay at Rome, moremar,
he had never entered his name as a citizen iu the census lisia Cicero now
undertoolr the deience of his old teacher and friend3 not, indeed, with astrim
legal argumentation, for the proofs were wanting, but he sets up the dignity
of the accused, tue affection he had met with everywhere, and his services to
literature aud art, as so many proofs of the truth of his amartion that he was
in lawful possession of the Roman franchise; nay, Cicero maintains that if
Archias were not already a Roman citizen, his life and merita made it a duty
· for Rome to adluit him among the number of her citizens, in order to secure
a man of such eminence to the commonwsalth. Such a dafenes. which
