has been made since their appearance in the careful collation

and correct deciphering of the best MSS. of Cicero’s writings, ·

will be ready to admit, without hesitation, that il nothing more
should be attempted, anew and improved text was called ior.
The labors of Orelli, Madvig, Klotz, aud others, have not been
without important results for the text of Cicero, aud no one
will deny that these results are os primary importanoe to he·
ginuers in the study oi the chassics. The editor felt therefore
that he would render an esse'atial service to the cause of accu-
rate scholarship, if he did nothing more than furnish a text as
correct as possible. It was not his plan, however, to present
a text which should he made up of several others, however
good, and correspoud entirely with uo one. He was convinced
that it would more oemainly meet the views of seholars and
teaohers‚ if he should select the text which might he consid·
ered on the whole the best for his object, sud give a eareful
and exact reprint of that. He has accordingly intended in
this edition to give the text of Orelli, as revised by him sub·
sequently to his edition os the entire worhs oi Cicero, and
published in avolume containing fifteen orations. This re·
mark refers to all the orations given in this volume, except
those for Marcellus and for Milo, which are not found in Orelli's
revision. The ⁴text oi the Milo is a reprint oi that of Madvig;
and of the Marcellus, of that oi Klotz. The principal varis·
tiens iu the most recent editions, from the text, which has
been in either case adopted, are noticed iu the notes. This
has been done often with what may at first sight appear unne-
cessary minuteness, hut the editoris convinced that ateacher
may make use oi various readings to the advantage os the pu-
pil, even at this stage oi his progress. ¹

The notes have been collected ireely from any sources which
ware within the editor's reach. It will resdily appear to those
who are acquainted with the subject that they have been largely
drawn from the productione oi German scholarship. Thess
which were given in Amold’s edition are here retained in full.
