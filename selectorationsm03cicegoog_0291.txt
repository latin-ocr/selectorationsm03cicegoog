thinks that the separation of the negative particle gives it prominence

, and sharpens the irony-Propinquus mens. So ch. 3, d 8: adole-

to this relationship obviously to show that his predilection should be in
favor of tho accusor, aud, therefore, that his confidence must be grain
in the innocense of Ligarius-Q. AEls'as Tubero, having failed in his
charge against Ligarius, devoted himself exclusively to the stndy of
jurisprudence. He was a writer on publio aud private law, and is
often mentioned in the Digest.

with Antony, near Mutina (Merena). When tribune of the people,
a. o. c. 703, he, with his colleague Caelius, opposed the decree of the
senate to appoint asuccsssor 10 Caesar in the command of the province
of Gaul. Tho intimacy and affection which existed between him and
Cesar may he learned from cd Fam. 6, 12. That the words pre·
stanti vir ingenio are spoken without irony, appears also from the
same epistic-

4. Fratris . . . . ausus est· The force which these words add to
the irony of 1110 passage should be noticed. Audeo and non dubito,
when not used merely as auxiliarios for form’s sake, but t'vith full aad
emphatic meaning, ara put before their infinitiva.
