and thus eonsennded the preconcertod combinatione 'Ihe danger being past,
certain roeolutions were proposed in the senate with regard ιο the authorsot‘

this abortire attempt; but the proceedings were quashed hythe intercession
os a tribune. The plot was, however, a matter os common discussion, and no
one menae to heve entertained any doubt os its reality, while many did not
scruple to assert thet Μ. Oramus and Julius Caesar, who was then sedile, were
deeply involved. (Q. Cic. da pet. Cous. ι, &c3 Asconius in Tog. cond. and
in Comel.,· Sall. Colit. 15-le; Liv. Epit. 1015 Dion Cass. xxxvi ιη Sueten.

Encouraged rather than disheartem by a sailure which had so nearly
proved a triumph. end which had eo distinctly demonstrated the practicability
oseuch a projeci, is conducted with common pmdence and caution, Catilius
was soon aller (a c. 65) lest completely unfettsred, by his acquittel upon trial
ior extortion, a mult secured, it was alleged, by the liberal bribes administer·
ed ιο the accuser as well as to the jury. From this time he seerne ιο heve de-
tennined to proceed more systematically3 to ealist amore numerous body ot
supportcrs3 to extend the sphera os operatione, and to organize s more com·
prehensive and sweeping scheme ol destruction. Accordingly, about the
beginning os June, a. c. 64, probably soon aiter the successful termination oi
hissecoml trial, when called to account sor the blood which he had ebed
during the proscription ot Sulla (Dion Cass. xxxvii 10), he began, while
convaseingvigorously lor the consulship, tosound the dispositione os various
persons, by pointing out the probable succes oi a grem revolutionary mov!-
ment, end the bright prospect of power and proiit opened up to its promotore.
Atler having thus ascenained the temper of different individuale, he called ιο
gether those who from their necessities, their characters, and their sentiments,
were likely ιο be most sager and most resolute in the undertaking. The meet-
ing, according ιο Sallust, was attended by eleven senators, by four membeis
os the equestrian order, and by several men ol rank and influence lrom the
provincial towns. 'lhe most conspicuous were P. Cornelius Lentulus Sura,
who had been consul in s. c. τι, but having been passed over by the censeas
had lost his seat in thamnata, which he was now secking to recover by
standing a second dme sor the praetorship (Dion Cam. xxxvii. ³0); C. Cor·
nelius Cethegus, distinguished throughout by his impetience, headetrong im·
petuosity‚ and sanguinary violence (sah. Cot. ⁴³3 Cic. pro Sall. 19); P. Au-
tronios, spoken os above; L. Cassius Longinus, at this time a competitor lor
the consulship, dull and heavy, but bloodthirsty withal (Cic. in Cot. iii. t-og
pro Sullo,13); L. Vargunteius, who had been one os the colleaguesos Cicero in
the quaestorship, and had subsequently been condemned lor bribery (pro Sall.
5, o, le); L. Calpurnius Bestia, tribune elect; Publius and Servius Sulla,
nephews os the dictator; M. Porcius Laeca (Cic.· in Cot. i, 4, ii. e, prosali.

nobility were known ιο be favorably inclined, although they had not openly
committed themselves; and now, as on the sonner occasion, rumor included
Crassm and Cesar, although the repert does not appear to have gained gen-

proceeded todevelop hisobjects and msources. He proposed that all debts
