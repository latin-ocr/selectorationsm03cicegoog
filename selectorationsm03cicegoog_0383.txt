ashes

The immediate effect of the death of Clodius was to depress the Milonian,
and to reanimato the Clodian fection. Milo at first meditated voluntary ex·
ile. But the excesses of his opponents made his presence once more possible
at Rome. The tribune of the plebs, M. Cealius, attended him to the forum,
and Milo addressed the assembly in the white robe of a candidate, and pro-
ceeded with his consular oauvavs. But a more powerful, though secret, oppo-
nonthad meanwhile risen up against Milo. llis competitore in thecomitia
,ποτε Ρ. Plautius Hypseus and Q. Metellus Scipio. Cn. Pompey had married

a daughter of Scipio, and from Hypsoeus he expected aid in gratifying the
prime object of ' ambition-the dictatorship. A bill for his appointment
was not indeed mulgated. But the senate nominated him sole consul.
Pompey immediately brought forward three laws, which, frorn their immedi-
ate reference to the circumstances of the times, were in fact privilegio. ln
the first he specially noticed the murder at Bovilloe, the conflagration of the
Curia Hostilia and the Porciau Basilica, and the attach upon the house ol M.
Lepidus the interrex. In the second, he introduced more stringent penalties
for ambitus ,· and in the third he increased the severity of the existing lawe
against sodalitio, or illegal iuterference with the freedom of the comitia]
The time allowed for trials de Vi, Ambitu, sedatius, was also much short·
encd, only three days being assigned to the accusation, the delence, and the
examination of witnesres Μ. Caelius opposed these lawe on the ground that
they were privilegia and retrospective. But Pompey stitied all opposition by
surrouudiug his house aud gerdens with soldiers, aud withdrawing himself
from the senate and the forum, en pretence of dreading Milo’s violence. Α
variety of charges and recrimiuations was brought forward by either fection.
The slaves of Mile and Clodius were respectively required to be given up to the
torture; and perjury and intimidation, the forms of law, and the abusa of jus-
tice, were put inactiva requisition. Milo, however, was not without hope,
since the higher aristocracy, from jeaiousy of Pompey, supported him, and
Cicero underteolr hisdefence His tn'al opened on the fourth of April, r. u. c.
tot. He was impeached by the two Clodii, nephews of the deceased, de l'i ,⁴
by Q. Petulcius arrd L. Cornificius, de Amasim arrd by P. Fulvius Neratus,
de sodalitiis. L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, a consular, was appointed quaesi·
tor or investigator, by a special law ot‘ Pompey’s, and all Rome aud thousarrds
of spectators from Italy througed the forum and its aveuues from dawn to suu·
set during these memorable proceedings. But lllilo's chauces ol acquittul,
faint even had justice been decorously administered, were wholly marred by
the virulence of his adversaries, who insulted arrd obstructed the witnesses,
the process, and the conductore ol the defence. Cn. Pompey availed himself
of these disordcrs to line the forum arrd ilsencompassing hilis with soldiers.
Cicero was intimidated, and Milo was condemned. llud he even been ac·
quitted on the first count de Vi, the two other charges of bribery and conspir-
acy awaited him. He therefore went into erile. Cicero, who could not de-
liver, rewrote and expanded the defence of iliis-the extant oration-and
sent it to him at Marseilles. Milo remarlred, “l am glad this was not spoken,
since l must have been acquitted, and then had never known the delicate tla-
vorof these Marseille-mullets.” Milo’sexile was a heavy blow to hisrrumer·
oua creditore.

The close of Milo’s life was as inglorious, as his political career had boen
violent and disgraceful. Milo expected a recall from Caesar, when, in a. u. c.
7⁰5, the dictator permitted many of the exiles to mturn. But better times
