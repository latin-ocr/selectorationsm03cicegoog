Νώὶῖ DDIOTARUS.

INTRODUGI'ION.

Duronsaur was a noble tetrarch of Gallogrecia or Galatia, who in the aev-
eral ware in which the Romans had been engaged in Asia, Pontus, Cappado-
cia, Cilicia, and Syria, had otton afforded powerful aid to their generals, and
proved himself a nealorrs and faithful ally. Through Pompey, after the close
of the Mithridatio war, he was, for his services, honored by the senate with
the title of king, and had Gadilonitis and Annenia Minor added to his domin·
iona. He succeeded, indeed, doubtlets by Roman favor, in encroaching on
the rights of the other tetrarcha of Galatia, and obtaining nearly the whole of
it for himself.

ln the civil war, Deiotarus attached himself to the cause of Pompey, hia
benefactor, ln the same ship with whom he affected his escape after the battle
of Pharsalia After the defeat of Pompey, he aought in every way to regain
the favor of Caesar, relying upon the friendly relations which had previously
existed between them. Accordingly, while Caesar was employed in Egypt,
Deiotarus offered to Cn. Domitius Calvinus, Caesar’s legate in Asia, his ser·
vices aod money, and ia hia turn, a. u. c. 707, applied to Domitius for aid
against Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates, who had taken possession of his
kingdom of Armenia Minor, and of Cappadocia, the kingdom of Ariobar-
zanes, and was plundering them. In the campaign which followed, Phar·
neces defeated the combined Roman and Galatian forces near Nicopolis, and

· almost entirely destroyed the army of Deiotarus. When Cesar, in thesemo

year, came into Asia from Egypt, Deiotarus, divested of his royal robes, wait-
ed on him in the gerb of asuppliant, and in considerationes his former sen
vices, his age, diguity, and the prayers of his friends, received a panion, and
was pennitted to resume the ensigns of regal dignity. About cenain claime,
however, which the neighboring tetrarcha made on Gallograecia, Caesar de-
cided nothing; but taking with him all Deiotarus’s cavalry, and a legion
trained in the Roman discipline, he proceeded against Pharnaces, whose
speedy deleat is reconled in the memorable words, ‘⁴ Veni, vidi, vici.'’

Cesar, after this victory, proceeding to Ana, by the route of Gutograeeia
and Bithynia, became the guest of Deiotams. He took from him, however,
the tetrarchy of the 'frocmi and gave itto Mithridates of Pergamus, whom he
had made king of the Bosporus. The kingdom of Armenia M inor also, which
Pharnaces had wrested from Deiotarus, Caesar did not restore to Deiotarus, but
bestowed it on Ariobarzanes, king of Cappadocia Thus Deiotarus was leti
with almost nothing more than his original tetrarchy. We leam from Cicero
(nd Att. 14, 1), that in the autumn of thesemo year, the cause of Deiotarus

was uasuecessfully pleaded by Brutus before Caaaret Nicea in Bithynia3
but that Brutus interceded for Deiotarus in this matteris highly improbable,
and in what other relation he defended Deiotarus is equally uncertain When
Cesar returned from Spain, s. u. c. 7⁰9, Castor the grandson of Deiotarum, by
a daughter who was married to Saooondarius, accused hia grandfather of a
