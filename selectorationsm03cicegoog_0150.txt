were confirmed by the Allobroges, end the chain of testimony was rendered
complete aad conclusive by the signatures in the heudwriting of the ringlead·

seven others being thus established beyond a doubt, Lentulus was forced to
abdicate his office, and then along with the rest was consigned to the charge
of certain individuale of high station who becarm responsible t'or their appear·

Thesecircumstancesas they had occurred having been fully detailed by
Cicero in his third oration, delivered in the forum, a strong reaction took
place among the popnrlace, who all now joined in execrating Catilius and de·
manding vengeance, from the well-founded conviction, that although they
might have derived profit from riot or even from civil war, yet the general
conflagration, which had always formed a leading feature in the schemas of
the conenheim, must have brought rain upon the humblest mechanica as
Nwell as upon the wealthiest of the aristocracy. On the other haud. a vigorous
effert was made hythe cliente of Lentulus ιο excite the drsgs of the multitude

After an animated debete, cf which the leading arguments are strongly and
pointedly expressetl in the two celebrated orations assigned by Sallust tn Caesar
and to Cato, a decree was passed, that the last punishment should be inflicted
according to ancient usage upon the convicted traitors. Thereupon the consul

the others were conducted thither by the pratens. On the selfsame night,
the high-born patrician Lentulus, a member of the noble Cornelia gens, was

of his associatae shared his fate. ’

While these things were going on at Rome, Catilina had gradually collected
a force amounting ιο two legions, although not above onefourth partos the
whole, or about 5,000 men, were fully equipped, the rest being armed with
pilres, clubs, and other rude weapons which chance presented. On the ap-
proach of Antonius, Catiline, tearing to enconnter regular troops with this
motley crowd, threw himself into the mountains, and, by constantly shittiug
his ground and moving rapidly in different directions, contrived ιο avoid a
cellision, while at the same time he exercised and disciplined his followers,
whose numbers daily increased, although he now refraed ιο enrol slaves. rnul-
