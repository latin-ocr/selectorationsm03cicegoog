great mental and physical powers, from which even his most bitter enemies
could not withhold a tribute cf admiration, combined with the extensive pop
ularity which he had acquired among the young by his agreeable address,
varied eccomplishmerrts, and unweeried real in ministering to their pleasures,
'must have tended to augment his natural aelf-confidence, to foster his pride,
arrd tc stimulate hia ambition. How soon the idea of destroying the liberties ol
his country may have entered his thoughts it is impossible to discover, but we
can readily believe that the career cf Sulla was ever present to his imagination,
, that his grand aim was tc become what the dictator had been, and that, pro
vided this end was accomplished, he felt little scmpulcus about the meane
employed. And, in truth, when he loolred abroad, the moment seemed most
propitious for the advancement of a man of daring and powerful intellect un·
controlled by principle. The leading statesmen were divided into factione
which eycd each other with the bitter jealcusy engendered during the convul-
sione in which they had played an active part some twenty years before. The

k , younger nobility,asa class‚were thoroughlydemcralized, for the mostpart

bankrupts in fortune as well as in fame, eager -for any change which might
relieve them from their embarrassments, while 'it held out the promise of un-
restrained lioense. The rabble were rentes and disconteuted, filled with envy
and hatrcd against the rich and powerful, ever ready to follow at the bidding
of any seditious demagogue. Thus, at home, the dominant party in the
senate, and the equites or capitalists alone felt a deep interest in the stability
ofthe gcvernment. Moreover, a widespread feeling of disaffectionextended
over the whole of Italy. Many of the veterana of Sulla, accustomed to riotous
living and profuse expendium, had already squandered their hoards, and
locled forward with anxiety to the renewal of those scenos of blood which
they had found by experience so profitable; while the multitude whose estates
had been confiscated, whose relations had been proscribed, and who them·
salves were suffering under civil disabilitiesin consequence cf their connection
with those who had thus perished, were eagerly watching for any movement
which might give them a chance of becomlng oppremere, robbers, and mun
derers in their turn. ⁴

Never was the executive wealrer. The senate and magistrates were wasting
their energias in pettydisputes, indifferent to the great interests of the com·
monwealth3 Pompey, at the head of all the best troops of the republic, was
prosecuting a long-protracted and doubtful war in the East; thera was no
army in Italy, where all washushedin a treachercusoalm. If then, Catilina,
surronnded aa he was by a large body of retainers all devotedly attached tqhis
person and detached from society at large hythe crimes which he had sng-
gested or prcmoted, had succeeded in striking his first great blow, had he as·
sassinated the consuls and the most able of theeenators, the chauces were,
that the waverers among the higher renlrs would have at once espousad his

cause, that the populace would have been intimidated or gained over, aud ·

that thousands of ruined and desperate men would have mahed from all quar-
ters to his support, enabling him to bid detianco to any force which could have
been brought to bear upon the city until the retum of Pompey from the Eaet.
But Pompey might never return, or might not return victorious, or, at all
events, along period must elapsa, and ample time would be given for negotia-
tione 0r resistance. Such were the probabilities which led on Cutiline to haz-
ard all upon one great throw ;-but the fortune of Rome prevailed, the gambler
was ruiued, and the state saved. (Sall. Cutilia. ,· Dion. Cass. xxxvi. 27, mvii.
