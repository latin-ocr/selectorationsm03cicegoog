design to murder Caesar, when he was his guest in Ganograecia, and also os
an intention os sending troops to the aid os Caecilius Bassus. Deiotarus sent
an embassy to Rome to look after his interests, and with them his slave Phi·
dippus, who was at the same time his physician. But he, while in Rome,
was corrupted by Castor, and appeared against his master. This embassy
waited on Cicero, who readily undertook the cause of his old friend, and in
November of this year, before Coesar in his own house, defended him in the
following speech. Os Cicero’s success we are not informed3 but from Phil.
2, 37, 94, it would appear that while Caesar lived, Deiotarus’s circumstances
did not improve. Aster the murder of Caesar, Hieras appears to have obtained
from Antony, through Fulvia, the restitution os his master’s dominions sor
10,ooo,0⁰0 sesterces. Deiotarus, however, had seized by force on the territory
in question, as soon as‘ he heard of Caesar’s death, and took revenge upon his
son-in-law and daughter. He subsequently joined the party os Brutus and
Cassius, and having attained an advanced age, was succeeded by Deiotarus
11.. his only surviving son, all the rest os his children having been put to death
by him, according to Plutarch, in order that his kingdom, in the hands of his
succeoeor, might not be shorn os its power. ,Μ

ANALYSIS.

1. 11« the introduction the orator speaks ot· his embarrassment and confusion,
which he generally seels in important cases, and which is increased still
more by the circumstance, (1) that he has to defend a king. and a king who
has done great service to the Roman people. Resides, (2) he is agitated by
the cruelty and unworthiness of the two accusers (ὁ 1-3) , and even (3) the
unusual constitution ot· the court. since the offended Caesar is at the same
time judge; as likewise (4) the place in which he must speak, a room in
Caesar‘s palace, instead of the public forum, add to his embarrassment.
(Φ 4-7)

Π. Before replying to the charge and resuting it. he speaks os the hope ot* the
accusers, on which they relied, in the belief that Caesar had not sincerely
pardoned Deiotarus. an opinion which is alike inconsistent with the noble
sentiments os Coesar and with his previous expressions respecting the king.
(9 7, 8.) By this he prepares the way sor the mention os what Deiotarus
had done (Ι) sor Pompey, (2) t'or Caesar. and (3) how Coesar had received
his endeavors. (t 9-15.)

111. The simple statement is a refutation os the charge: sor (l) so inconsid-
erate an act is at variance with the well-known prudence and character of
the king (ὁ 1⁵, 16); (2) the whole accusation is a clumsy invention, and
every thing which has been brought t'orward to prove it, is utterly improba-
ble and absurd (ο 17-22) ς (3) the king had no wish to levy an army against
Caesar, as the accusers maintained (θ 23, 24) ; (4) Deiotarus did not cherish

§hostile feelings against Caesar (θ 24-27); but (5) it was Castor rather. who
was so disposed (θ 28, 29), who, ungrateful and treacherous (ο 30-32), had
impudently fabricated a story, that Blesamius had by letter communicated
to the king, his master, something prejudicial to Caesar. (θ 33, 34.)

lv. 'The conclusion mentions the gratitude ot· the king, and his contentment
with Caesar's treatment (ο 35-39) ; and seeks to enlist the sympathy and fa-

- vor ot caesar in behalf of the two kings, the father and son.
