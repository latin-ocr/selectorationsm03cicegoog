“ 'rho characteristics ol‘ this volume are: precision, condensation, end luminous arrangement.
lt is precisely what lt retends to be-a manual, a sure and conscientious guide sor the student
through the crooks an tanglesos Mediaeval history. ' ' · · All the great principles ot this
extensive Period are ceretull laid down, ond the most important facts skrlsully grou ed around
them. There isne period οἵ History sor which it isnmore difficolt to prepare a worp like this,
and none tor which rt rs so much needed. 'l'he leading facts ere well established, but they ere
scattered overan immense space, the principles are ascertained, but their development was
slow, uaequal, and interrupted. There rs a general breaking up os a great body, end e parcelling
os it out among small tribes, conceming whom we have only a few general data, and ere lest ιο
analogy and conjecture sor the details. 'rhen come successive attempts at or ennolion, each
more or less inde ndent, and all very imperfect. kt last, modern Europe {egino slowly ιο
emerge from thee aee, hut snll under forms vvhrch the most diligent histonan cannot alwavs
comprehend To reduce euch materiale to a clear and definite form is a task os no small diffi-
culty, and in which artiel success deserves great raise. Itis not too much ιο say that rt has
never been so well done within a corn so ensis} mastered‚ es in the little volume which is

now offered ιο the public.”-Ectroct rom American Pveface.

“This translation oi a foreign school-book embraces a succinet end well arranged hod οἰ
facts concerning ‘European and Asiatie history and geography during the middle ages. ftis
l'urnrshed with printed questions, and rt seems to be well adopted to rts purpose, ln ell respects.
The mediaeval period is one os the most interesting in the annale os the world, and a knowledge
of its great men, and os its progress in arts, arms, government and religion, is anicularly im·

v portant since this period is the basis os our own socral polity.”-Oommerciol Advertere.

“This is an immense amount os research condensed into a moderately sized volume, in away
which no one has patience ιο do but a Gennan scholar. 'l'he beauty os the work is its luminous

chaos from which modern Europe was at length to ause.

The author has brietiy taken up me principnl olltrcal and social lnlluencee which were
acting on society, and shown their bearing from t e time previous to the migratione of the
Northem natione, down through the middle ages to the sixteenth century. 'l'hc notes on the
crueades are particularly valuable and the range os observation embraces not only Europe but
the lieet. Το the student it will be a most valuable Handbook, eev' him a world os trouble
