onsnon POB mnu DEIOTABUB.

See note on p. 71, line un-Accedir, ut. When the sentence is con-98⁸3

ditional‚ aceedit is always followed by ut. Without a condition we

sometimes lind accedit ut, but more commonly accedit quod. With

quod an added circumstance is presupposed as real; with ut it is con-

ceived as just developing itself = praterea fit, ut See Z. 621, 622.

, 13. Alterius crudelitate· Because his grandson Castor was

the accusor of his grandfather.-Aiterius indignitate. Because hia
e slave Phidippus had appeared against his master.

14. crudelis castor· So also Benecke, Klotz, Steinmetz, aud
Saldan. Madvig aud Schneider defend Crudelem Castorem, on the
ground that ne dicam requires the same ome of the substantive or ad·
jective before as after n Cf. p. Mn §3³2 oieo Milone, ne dicein

omnino initio orationis exclamatio minus apposita videtur. Orelli

16. Nepos· 'Phe son of his daughter, who had married Saucon-
dariua-Addunerit. The subjunctive expresses not merely some ad·

20. Fugltlvl· This is said contemptuously of Phidippus, since
when sent with the other ambassadors to defend Deiotarus, hs had
abandoned his cause. His object, in speaking so contemptuously of
his servile condition, is to make the accusation of Deiotarus appear
still more unworthy, and to lower and wealren in the minda of tho
Romans the regard in which Phidippus stood in his own country. On
the repetition of dominum, comparead An. 5,2,1: quum Hortensius
veniret et infirmus et tam longe et Hortensium p. Soet. 664ι ge·
