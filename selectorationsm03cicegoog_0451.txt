in the Alban land 3 and it would appear that in the huildlng ol it helf3⁸⁸⁸0
had destroyed some old groves and altars attached to Mons Albanus,
where the Latinae ferire were celebrated. Mons Albanus was covered
with trees; bnt we may suppose that every little hillock and grove
was the site of an altar for these occasions.

41. Sacrorum populi Romani sociae et aquales· Liv. 1,7,
says ol Romulus: Socra diis aliis Albano ritu, &cco Herculi at
ob Evandro instituto erant, facit. The worship of Vesta particularly
was derived from Alba After the destruction of Alba, the joint wor-
ship continued, whence Cicero, mskiug use ol an expression of public
law, calls the Alban altars populi Romani socies ct (aquales. As in a
surrender tho conquered people were obliged to make over to the
Romans divina hamanaque omnia, so the gods and sanctuaries were
included iu the league. The common worship of Juno Sospita in La-
nuvium aud Rome is well known. Liv. Β, 14, and above, ch. 10, 27.
The temples aud altars of Alba had not been destroyed in the destruc·
tion of the city; Clodius destroyed them.

4³. Substructlonum insanis molibus. sasenates. ’

44. [Am] This word, if correct, is the vocative, like obrutae
arc, above. Madvig now rejects it entirely. Klotz retains it without

1. Tuque Latiaris sancte Juppiter· The ferm Latiaris, 131
not Latialis, is confirmed by Priscian, though MSS. coufouud them.
In the sacred grove, on the lofty Alban meunt, sacrifice was per·
formed to Juppiter Latiaris, the guardian god ol the old Latin leagne,
and afterwards also the highest national god of Latium.

2. naeus. The beautiful Alban lake lay at the foot ol the
mountain on the west-an oval sheet of water about six or seven miles
in circumference. The plural is not merely oratorical, as other wri· >
ters also have Albani locus.

6. sorutae sunt· Cicero skilfully makes the death ol Clodius a
propitiatory sacrifice. His crimes against the gods had long before
brought down upon him the sentence Sacer esto, which it was every
one’sdutytoexecute. · · ν

6. Nisi rorte Cicero thought it absurd to denya providential
interference, in the fact ol his death happening in the very presence
of the goddeoe whose rites he had profaned.

1 . sacrarium Bonae Deae· The rencontre was near this chapel.

10. Acciperet. Steinmetz, Klotz, aud Silplle acceperit. In per-
fecto simplex inest facti notio: in imperfecto etiam necessitatis et con-
silii divini, quasi dixisset3 nt enm oporteret vulnus accipere, ito co-
lente numine Bonos Dec. Unless we wish tc maintain that it was
mere chance, that he must receive that wcuud. See Z. 514.
