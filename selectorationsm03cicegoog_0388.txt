of people, that were gathered aronnd, when a publio trial, which en-
listed their sympathies, was iu progress. They represented the popu-

The text in this passage iavery doubtful. The better MSS. give noo
illa prasidior the common editions, nom itta prandia Garatoni
proposed nec itta presidia, and was followed by Madvig. The double
non . . . . non afferunt of the MSS., appearing strange and unusual,
occasioned the change of the former into nonu Klotz, however, who
'u followed by Siipfle and others, defends the first non, placed attha
head of the clause, which the second rhetorically repeated before offe·
runt does not destroy, aa giving energy and emphasis to the language.
In the following clause also the negation is made prominent a third
time, by saying: ut . . . . tomen ne aon timere quidem posmmus, in·
stead of ut . . . · tumen etiam non timere possimne. The sense of the
passage then is as follows: These gnards do not secure ..... Ι re·
peat, they do not secure to the orator, that we here in the forum, and
before the tribunal . . . can be so fearlem, that we should not at least
have some fear. Το this view Madvig objecto, that the position of non
in the beginning of the sentence, before the subject, and its rhetorical
repetition before the verb in a sentence which dows so smoothly, and
without excitement, is unusual and nncalled for. Resides, ilthe re-
peated oon is equivalent to a single negation, aliquid, he remarks, is
berbarons Further, the sentence, ut ne noa timere quidem, &c.,is
so annexed, as to require that an intimation of lear caused (not a mind
reliewed) should precede. Moreover, the connection of the sentence
with the preceding, and the continuation of the thought, is against the
non, which seenn to have arisen from the repetition of the non with
usitata. Gradually approaching his subject, the orator does not sirn-
ply affirm, Atque etiem ipen illc precidie afferunt oratmi aliquid et
enimam ejus perturbant, bnt employa the form of affirmetion which
arises from the negation of the opposite-Proeidiu. Compare bb 71,
