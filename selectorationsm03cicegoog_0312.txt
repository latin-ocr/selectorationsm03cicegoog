§greatly indebted to Com for his own, to urge the pardon of another,

than sor that other to hope for a pardon. But this being done, Coesar
would hardly forfeit the glory of his clemency, gained iu pardoning the
one, by refusing the same pardon to the other.

21. Tui necessarii· We might expect tuorum necessariorum,
but the construction is conformed to the relative qui, instead of to tho
antecedent corrant.

Cn. XL-24. Gratioslores. Of more influence with yona—Vul-
tus. What case? Ζ. 603, (b). Soldan with Steinmetz here contenda
for preces, as below. Vultus dixit pro preces quia, qui precantur, sol-
licitudinem, demisionem animi, moerorem vultu prae se ferre solent.

25. Sed qnam uuus. Klotz reads sed 'quos illius causa, pro
quo, διο.

26. ltaque, dcc. Accordingly, you do not, to be sure, deny your
own friends any favor, as the preceding remark (neque te spectare,
quam tuus esset necessarius) might lead a person to suppose. So far
from that, you are above measure liberal to them 3 still 1 see (sed vi-

27. Beatiorcs· Beatus qui multa bona possidet. Cicero does
not mean that they were happier than Coesar, but as we say, “ better

The friends of Ligarius have the juste‘st grounds (minor). Theresore,
&c In establishing the minor he is able to enumerate all the friends

line 2.

33. Hoc. Causas rogantium.

34. Sabinos. Ligarius was of Sabine origin, and it was usual for
the whole people of a district to appear at Rome in desence of a patron
or countryman. So the Campanians appeared in favor of Cicero, on
his return from banishment— Tibi probatissimos. They had afforded
Caesar an asylum during the proscription of Sulla, and he may have
tried and proved their valor in his legions.

36. Nosti optime homines· Benecke, Klotz, Soldan, and Mad-
vig from MSS. read optimos.
