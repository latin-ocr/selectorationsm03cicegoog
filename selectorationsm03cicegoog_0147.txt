This disappointment, while it increesed if possible the bittemeoeof his animos·
ity towards the dominant party among the anwocracy and the independent
portion of the middle ranke, rendered him more vigoroue in the prosecutiou of

neighhorhood of Foesula, under the superintendence of C. Manlius, an erpe-

made in various quarters to gain over the slaves, and it was determined, when
the critical moment should arrive for an open demonstrationi, to set lire to
the city in many different places at the earne metant, snd to ehughter the
welldisposed portion of the population in the tumult. Meanwhile, in the
