loser; the gainer 01 the cause receiving his bach. This pledge went
to the state, and was especially applied to the sacra publico ,· hence

2¹1. Jautculo et Alpibus, i. e. the entire ol upper Italy, from
Rome to Gaul-Terminabat. Klotz: terminarat.

28. Equtte Romano splendido. Equites Romani are the
knights, qui publico equo stipendio faciunt or qui equum pullicum
habent, Liv. 39, 9; 24, 18, in distinction from those qui equo privato

pare Lis. 39, 55. lt was a principle 01 the Roman law: accessio oe-

In the older law this was surely the rule without exception and without
limitation. Ι1 the huilder supposed the land his in good saith, he could
claim to be indemnified. Clodius came under the former case, hut he

 

did not sear the legal consequences, therefore he built even in sight 01
the owner 01 the island, ior his principle was, “might makes right,''
aad he shewed by his proceedings, that he hoped to acquire by force
the island, which the owner would not sall to hirn.
