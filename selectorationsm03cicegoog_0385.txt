canses which led Clodius ιο attempt the life of Milo. Clodius wished ιο
he praetor and Milo consul for the same year. This was quite contrary ιο
the desires os Clodius. Clodius, therefore, did not attempt to conceal the
fact. that he wished, expected, and would bring about the death of liiiio.
(Ch. 9.) Clodius took advantage of the occasion of a journey, which Milo
was called tc make on business, ιο 11ο in wait for him. The time and man·
ner ofhis journey exonerate Milo from the suspicion of having intended tc
waylay Clodius, while Clodius appears ιο have been prepared ιο commit
murder. The attack commenced against Milo. Several ofhis retinue were
elain, the rest supposed Milo had already tallen; without his command or
knowledge they killed Clodius. (Ch. 10.)

(l) application of the principle ofjustifiable homicide in selidefence ιο Milo,
who confesses the deed, but claime for himself J'ustitication therefor.
(Chii.)

(a) The proposition that Clodius was the waylayer, is drawn out more par·
ticularly.

(1) Milo’s death would bring grem advantages ιο Clodius: under such a con·
sul as Milo, he would not have been ahie to carry through his projected law
for introducing freed slaves into the tribes. An apostrophe tc Sextus Clo·
dius, who, for the purpose of exciting the people, deprived the corpse of
Clodius of honorable burlal. (Ch. ra.)

(2) The hostility of Clodius was to Milo, on the other hand, in his canvassing
for the consulship, not so mucha hinderance as an advantage, since Milo
seemed the only one capable of restraining, hy means of the consular pow-

· er, the mad projecta of Clodius: therefore the death of Clodius was inju-
rious ιο Milo, and could not for that reason have been designed by him.

(3) Clodius hated Milo personally3 hut liilo, Clodius only from political
grounds. (Ch. 13.)

(1) Clodius has always loved and practised violence, particularly in the ban-
ishment of Cicero. <Cia 14.)

(t) Milo on the other hand has used violence only in defence of the constitu·
tion, and generally, where he has had an opportunity ιο kill Clodius, has
treated him with forbearance: e. n the occasion of Cicero's recall from
banishment, and in other disturh s. (Ch. lt.)

(d) Milo could not have had any plan or purpose ιο take the life of Clodius,
because of the nearness of the consular electiori, and for fear of losing the
favor of the people.

(7) Clodius οιι the other hand had always shown contempt for the tribunale
and for public opinion. Ha believed, if Milo were put to death, he would
have all power in himself alone.

(8) Cato is witness, that Clodius said, Milo must be putto death. (Ch. lt.)

(9) Clodius knew that Milo about this time would be passing οιι the rond in
this vicinity, and hasterred ιο precede him, even ιο the neglect of much in
Rome. Milo did not know that he would meet Clodius: his joumey was
necessary for the performance of an official duty connected with the ritas
ofreligion (Cla 17.)

(10) Cicero, in his own defence, urges, that he could have had no knowledge
of a plan ιο murder Clodius. The pretext for the return of Clodius from his
estate, viz. ιο enter upon an inheritance‚ was a mere fiction. He joumeyed
to meet Milo on the road. (Chaps. 18, 19.)

(11) The place where the fray took place, shows that Clodius and not Milo
entertained the murderous design; sc also does the retinue of both.

(lt) The circumstance that Milo had armed men among his followers is not
surprising, since he was not at any moment secure against Clodius. (Ch.
ab.) Milo bestowed their freedom upon his slaves, not from tear that con-
lession would he forced from them by tortura, for ire comesses the fact him-
