16. Denoatrum omnium-0 An instance of the figure decoro
mas. Z. 823.

19. Et adspexit me. Phil. 2, 30, 76, At adspicio me, ct
quidem, ut viderie, irotue. The connection of these words with the
preceding is stili looso; but the language is animated, and the abrupt-
ness not outof place. “But see, he has caat such a look onme, as
he was aocustorned to wear, when be threatened all evile to every-
body ;'' sc. in the tribunate ol P. Clodius, when Sextus was the will·
ing instrument of all the injurios inflicted on Cicero.

20. Omnibus omnia· Klotz: omnio annilina—Lumen curie,

20. Imaginibus· See note on p. 131, line 14.-Ecseqaiis. A
following to the grare3 funeral procession, which pompa deo here
significa, and is therefore only amplificatory. The processioa crooeed
the forum, when the lectus funebris was set down in front of the rostra,
and the laudatio prononnoed. It then moved to the place where the

’ body was burned without the city. The ashes were getheredintoan
urn (condere), which was placed in the tomb (componore). Nothing
of this respect was shown to Clodius-Infelicissime lignis· An al·
lusion to the distinction between arbores felices and infelices in the
(Etruscan) pontificat language. An orbor infelix was taken for a
gallowe, which, it may be intimated, Clodius deserred. The body of
Clodius, however, was burned with the banchae, tables, oc, of the
