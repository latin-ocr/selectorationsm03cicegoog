13. 'l'c vero, dte. The orator bere pamas in a lively and ani-
mated manner, to that which is before his eyes, and by which there·
fors bis feelings are more deeply and strongly moved.

behold, expressive oi the desim to preserve what of the state has es·
caped the fortunent vvar. For et os, which Ernesti, Wolf, and Spal-

nectiou with the following at.

more bold, us the orator rises to the completiones hisclimax. Cf.

pardon oi others.

C. Marcellus was consul s. υ. c. 704. He was at first a zealous aud
nncompromising advocate oi the party hostile toCoesar. He, however,
remained in Italy, arrd obtained the forgiveness oi the conqueror. He
was the husband of Gaesar’s nisce Octavia, and at a later period, as
such, enjoyed aplane oi high consideration. He is osten conioundad ’
with a brother oi M. Marcellus, whose name was the same, and who
was consul s. u. c. 705. He appears to have perished in the civil
wars. For incomparabili Orelli, Schultz, and Steinmetz give comme-
morabili, which variation Klotz omits to notice.

mie, ita pectus Ciceronis dolore suffusum est.
