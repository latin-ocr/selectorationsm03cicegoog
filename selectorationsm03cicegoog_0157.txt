promulgated the agrarian lawa, he deprived his collengne Octavius ofhss

his office, and constituted himself, his father-indua Appius, and h‘u
brother Caius, a triumvirate for the division of landa and the plantation
of colonias Upon this, P. Scipio Nasica, his cousin-german, from the
upper part of the Capitol, summoned all who had at heart the welfare

ἡ of their country to follow him, and rushed upon the crowd of Grac·
chus’ adherente. Gracchus, es he flod, was surich down by the frag·
ment of a bench, and expired at the very gates of the temple of hides,
a. u. a. 621. Here and below, 2, l 4, Cicero speaks mildly of the of·
fauce of the Gracchi, to contrmt the conduct for which they suffered
with the iearful crime that Cutiliae meditated Another passage, in
which he speaks of the Gracchi with great moderatiori (but possibly,
says Klotz, to please the peoplo),is in the second book De Lege Agrar.

ntor, amantissimos plebi Romane onos, Ti. et 0. Gracchos, plebem
in agria publicio constituisse, qai agri a privatis antea possidebantur.
Non sans autern ego is Consul, qai, at plerique, nesae esee arbitrer
Graecias laudare,· quoram conubiis, sapientia, legibus multae esec

tilbetical character of this passage: “Hic et Catilina Graecia et
statua rei publiea orbi terrarum, et mediocria labefactatio cedi et
incendiis et variationi, ct privatus consulibua comparatur.” viii. 4,
14.-Pontrfea maximus. Cicem appears to have added these words
simply to remind his hearers thet Scipio was a distinguished and pru·
dent man, who'had had that high office. It agrees also vary well
with the subsequent privatus, since thepueethood was not strictly a
magistrncy, and accordingly the pontifex, unless he at the same time
held some magistracy besides, was only a private man. Consnlt
