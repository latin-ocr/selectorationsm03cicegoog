(is) The depositione of the slaves of Clodius are illegaliy demanded, and un·
reliable. (Ch ιι.)

(14) The confidence with which hillo appeared in public scon after the killing
of Clodius, and the contempt which he showed for the rumore aad false ac·
cusations in circulatim, prove his innoceuce: he was not even afraid of
Pompey, though attempta were made to excite his suspicions against Milo.

(a) Were Milo guilty, Pompey. by virtue ol the extraordinary power intrusted
ιο hlm, would hare been able, ere this, himself ιο punish him. (ch. 26.)

been put to death. An enumeration of his crimes. (Ch ill.)

(e) An intimation of what would have been ιο be feared from him.

(d) It follows, that Milo’s act is highly meritorious, since ιι may be called ty·
ranuicide. (chamle, ιι.)

(ο) The removal of Clodius is a benedt conferred upon the Roman people by
the immortal gods, whose presence and power have been signally displayed
in the destruction of this abandoned wretch, and in the preservatiou of
Rome from many evils. (Chaps. 30-33.)

(s) hlilo is commended to the sympathy of the judges, for his firm bearing
and the compcsure with which, conscious of his sincere love of his country,
he faces the possible nnfavorable issue of this trial ι for what he deserves of
all true patriots anti ol Cicero, for the sacrifice which he made ιο secure the
object of bending and controlling the violence of the mob, as directed by
Clodius against the fortunes of the higber ranis: for the fame which he has
wou, and the universal applause with which bis deed has been hailcd.
(Chaps. ³4, 35.) Cicero also, in his own name. as a grateful friend, aslis the
regard both of the judges and of th diers presentior the accused, re·
minding thern of the suppression of t conspiracy of Catiline, of his own
erile, and his recall through the instrumentality of Milo. (Chaps. 36, 37.)
hillo does not regret his deed. He deserves the thanlrs of his country, and
the jndges will by his acquittal show a manly spirit, and that too without
offending Pompey. (Ch. 38.)

The following brief outline of the argument in this oration we add from Fol-
som's edition.

The point of inquiry is, not whether Clodius was killed by Milo. for that is
contessed; but whether he was not lawfully killed This Cicero maintains
in the affirmative, by iaying down a general proposition, that it is lawful ιο
lrill theman, who lies in wait and attempts ιο lull you.

This general proposition he proves,—

lst. From the authority of the people, from former trials, and froin the laws
in being.

sd. From the silence of the lawa passed on that occasion, either hy the senate
or Pompey.

Having established this general proposition, the orator proceeds ιο prove that
clodius comes precisely under that description 3 this he does,-

lst. From the advantages that were to arise ιο the deceased by the death of
Milo.

ad. From the declared hatred he always expressed against hillo. Ι
