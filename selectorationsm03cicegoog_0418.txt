ἱῖὲ of the previous year, who were tools ef Clodius—Vestro volontatis

Cicero’s recall was the wish of the people, which Clodius hindered.

’ 19. Publici consensus· 'l'he voice of the people was almost
unanimous in the comitia ol the centuries fer Cicero’s return Pieoot
15, 34; Sest. 51, 109.-Septem pretores. Pieoo. ·15, 35: de one,
wem omncs magistrante promulgassent, praeter uuum pretorem, a
quo oon soit postulandum, fratrem inimici mei preterque duos de
lapide emptos tribunos. The pretor was Appius Claudius, the two
tribunes, Q, Numerius Rufus and Sex. Atilius Serranus.

20. Illius adversarii, defensores mel. Notius theahaphorein
the preceding clemen, and the chiasmus here. Mei ie to be referred
to Ζ, 424. Klotz: tribuni plebei.

21. cn. Pompeius. Pisort 15. Pompey, finding that Clodius,
presumiog too much on his populerity, began to think himself a match
for the triumvirate, faversd the recall of Cicero in order to keep him
in checlr.

22. Gravissimum et ornatissimam, i. e. gravitatis ac ponderis
plenissimam et iis, quae ad orationis elegantiam pertinent, instructissi-
mam. The oration od Quir. p. Red. 7, contains an abstrect of Pom·
pey’s speech on this occasion.

24. Decretum de me capuae feeit. Pisoo. 11, 25. Capua, be-
cause of its defection from Reme in the second Punic war, was se·
verely punished, and reduced to a prefectura- niv. 26, 16. Julius
Caesar, Α. u. c. 695, mede it a colonia civium Romanorum. Capua
could therefore take part in the restoration of Cicero. Pompey had
been appointed, by the Julian law, one of the Duumviri for governing
the new colony at Capua, in right of which office he mede this deorse.
Fecit not jecisset. See note on p⁴ 69, line 4⁰.

26. signnm dedit, gave the signal to convene. Like signum
sustulit, which is a military phrase, and therefore perhaps concurrere,
with the oetion of eogerness and haste, es in the first charge of battle.

27. Omnlatum deniqueeto. So else Klotz without the †. But
Madvig now adopts tho conjecture el Heumann: amisium denique t'n
illum odia civium, &c

29. cogitaretur is not for cogitatum esset, although we should so
speek, but the imperfect conveys the notion of continuenee or incom-
plotoness.

- 30. ln judicium bis, ad vim nunquam vocavit. See ch. 13,
35. On the variation of the proposition, Garatoni remarks: praepositi·

x onum variatio, ubi presertim sue cuique nomini propria ex usti tribui-
tur, tautum abest a vitio, utin elegentioe laude ponatur. Compare
note on p. 23, line 15.

31. Privato Milone, deposito tribunatu. Magistratus could not
es a general mle be accused during their magistracy.-Acousoote P.
Clodio. Soet. 44, 95. D. Cass. 39, 18, says Clodius wee no sooner
