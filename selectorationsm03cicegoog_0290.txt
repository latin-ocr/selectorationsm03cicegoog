ANALYSJS sp} ἢῆἑ 1

1. The introduction consiste oi a continued and well· sustamed irony. Cicero
ridicules Tubero, l'or bringing an accusation against Ligarius before Caesar,
on account cia matter that is known to everyb0dy; represents himself as
stripped ci ali means of deience, hythe charge oi so unheard ot a crime,
as the having been in Africa3 and proceeds ιο treat tlte whole accusation
as triding and contemptible. lie accordingly goes on, in subtle and covert
irony, to urge that the discloeure oi this crime compels him to rescrt to
cesar‘s humenity as his only refuge ; hy which, he adds, so many already
have been preserved ιο their country, whom caesar has pardoned, not scr
any crime, but only ior an error, and arucng thern Tubero also, who. how·
ever, as well as his father, hrrs mere ιο answar for ιο Caesar, than Ligarius
who is charged by them with a crime {rom which they ara not able to
clear themselves. (t 1,2.)

t. The nmation shows, thet Ligarius was in Africa, but without any fault
cibis own, and not as cassare enemy; ior,

(a) He went as legate into the province oi Africa before tha cuthrealr oi war
was suspected;

(b) lle was constrained, when Considius withdrew, by the urgent wish oi
the inhabitants, against his will to assume the government oi the provinca;

(c) He refused the commend offered ιο him, but was unable, becoming in·
volved in the war, to escape irom tha province. (t 3-5.)

3. The argument itseli has two parts: the first invalidates the charge oi the
accuser, the second commenda Ligarius ιο Caesar’s mercy.

(ι) The orator introduces his proot oi the wealrness oi Tubero’s accusation
by a panegyric en Caesar, ior having spared him who had been a Pompeiau
(t r-s) and then shows

(ι) How unwise and inconsiderate the accusation is, since the accuser had
actually fought against Caesar, while the accused had only heen ιιι Attica
(ι ⁹. ¹⁰);

(ι) llow cruet and inhumari, since it alme at the death ol Ligarius (t 11, ιι),
οι at least hinders his pardon (t ts, ιι), a cruelty which Cicero purposely
depicts in the strongest colors (t 15, lt); .

(ο) How unreasonable and unjust, since Tubero has called the error oi Liga-
rius treason, wherehy he reflecte upon the whole party oi Pompey, anderen
condemns his own and his father's course (t 17-19); in respect to (1) his
o'wn journey to Africa. which was entered upon by command oi the senate

t til-2³). (2) his zealto defend this province (t 24). and (3) his firmness and
consistency, in supporting the party οι the senate, even atter his affront
(ι ,ΜΒΝ

(ιι) How absurd sud foelish ir is, to desire that cesar, who has pardoned
public offences, should avenge private grievancea (t ιιι.)

(2) He directa hie dmcourse ιο secure pardon ior the accused, and,

(a) ln connection with praise oi Caesar, he males franlr contession ef his own
mistalre and fault (t 30, ιι);

(ι) lle draws a touching picture ei the sorrow aud distress οι tire brothers
and mnemon oi Ligarius, who are present. and have been constant friends
of Caesar (t ss-st);

(c) He brietly sets ic'rth the merita oi one oi the brothers, Teligarius, ior ser·
rice done tc cesar, who now is reminded that he has itin his own power,
to show him a grateful recollection oi the teror (t ³⁵, tt);
