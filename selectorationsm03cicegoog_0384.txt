ANALYSIS.

In the introductioa the orator confessas, that the sight oi the place of trial
surrounded by armed men is somewhat terriiying to him: he however ex·
presses his conviction, that Pompey has adopted this arrangement only the
better to secure to the law its due course ; aad his assurance that the better
class oi citizens are strongly inclinedin favor oi hlilo. (eh. 1.) 'l'he rest,
a turbulent moh, composed oi the hirelings oi Clodius, will fail to fnghten
the judges, who now have an opportunity to testily ιο aman who deserves
so well oi the lovers oi their country, as hillo, the sympathy which is his
due. Thea follows an intimation oi his leading position: that the taking
of Clodiua's lile was an act oi sels defense. (Ch. n)

The oration itseli may he divided into three parts.

1. Α refutation of the allegatione oi the opponenrs :-

(a) “That the taking oi human lile is in all cases inexcrrsahle.” This is
invalidated by examples drawn from Roman history, irom the mythos
Orestes, hythe laws oi the twelve tahles, and by the nature of the case.
(cremat.)

(h) ‘¹ That the taking ol Clodius‘s iiie was a violation oi the Roman constitu·
tion‚” 'l'he senate. as cicero also admits, did indeed metense ot this lan·
guage ; but it wished, notwithstanding. that the case should he tn'ed under
existing laws, only immediately, without the delay which would ordinarily
ensue from awaiting its turn. Pompey, on the othei· hand, carried a special
law ior this case. But he wished only to secure the course ofjustice,and ia
fact recognised the possibility oi lililo‘s acquittal. <Chaps 5, d.)

(o) ¹⁴ The murder ol Clodius is the more deserving oi punishment, because it
occurred on the Appian road, which is a monument ot his illustrious an·
cestor.” The renown oi Drusus and of Scipio Africanus the younger did
not protect them from murder, which was not even investigated. Clodius
too had previously contaminated the Appian way hy a deed of murder. He
had also attempted the lile os Pompey aad others, aad no special investi·
gatron had on that account been ordered. (Ch 7,)

(d) Pompey’s mensures, and the choise oi the judges, who are distinguished
meri, iurnish no ground lor an anlavorahlc judgment against Milo. (ch. 8.)

a. The prooi that Milo killed Clodius in seli-deience.
