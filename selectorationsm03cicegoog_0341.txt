necessary. The imputation on Castor ie this: that after Phidippus
had received his first bribe, aud given his testimony, he ackaovvledged
before respectable witnesees that it was false, and that he had been

⁸ corrupted. But he now persiste in tbe same talo. The reference
drawn by Cicero is, that the bribe must bave heca repeated.

23· Ad legatos. N amaly, Hieras, Blesamius, aad Antigonus, a
quorum pedibus per te abstractus erat.

24. Nonne ettam ad hunc Ga. Domitium. Probably the same

’ Domitius who ismentioned, ch. 5, as a general of Gasar'a Sulpicius
isthe celebrated lawyer, a friend of Cicero, and zealoue adherentes
Cesar. They vvere both present on this occasion, as may be inferred
from theuso of the pronoun lic. So below, oh. 14: huic Blesamio,-
p. Araia 9: hujus proaoar Galo. Benecke, Klotz, and Madvig omit
etiam. Orelli says: Servavi curn Cod. Bern. v. etiamr videlicet sig·
nificat, ‘¹ vel ad ipsum Cn. Domitium, eesms amicum, venisse Phidip-
pum, sui indicii jamjam poenitentem.”

26. T. Torquato. The Torquatus bere mentionedis uncertain.
Orelli, in hie Onomasticon, makes him theson of Α Torquatus, orof
the Titus vvbo is mentioned in Brut. 70, ,245; aad p. Plana. ll, 27.

Cir. xli-ae. impotens. The common text gives impudens,
ethich Orelli supposes was substituted by copyists for the true reading,
from ignoranoe of the unae which impeteris bere has. Compare Plit
5, 9, 24: impotentem, iracundam, contumeliosam, superbum, aem·
per mareotem, sempor rapientem, comper ebrium. Impoteaa in such
cases ie not = weak, but trngoveruable, violent, tyrannical.

30. iccirco . . . . ut. See note on p. 26, lino a-Jn hana arbem
...eujus arba. The repetition is for emphasia In line ³2. the
MSS. give inhumanitate for immanitate, and so Benecke, Klotz, and
Madvig read Frotscher prefers immanitate.

31, Domestica = Adatio and barbarous.

33. st quam acute collecta· lrunicsily, for Castor’s charges
vero rather sn invective against the tyranny ol Coesar than an inju-
rious accusation of Deiotarus. Compare ch. 6, 19: At qaam scotiae

crima conterritam—Blesamius, with Hieras and Antigonus, formed
the embaesy sent by Deiotarus to pleam his causa before Ceasar. See
ch. 15. Him the accusare pretended to be a spy.

34· Enim has an ironical force = forsooth. Itonia in eo posita
