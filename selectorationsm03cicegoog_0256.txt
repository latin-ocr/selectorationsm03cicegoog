consul, aud the conqueror oi Syracuse-Scipioni. Manutius under-
stande the younger Africanos—Mario. C. Marius, seven times con-
sul. Gi. note on p. 45, line aa-Et ceteris. In concluding au enu-
meration oi several persons or things, is et common with atii and

39. nt ad gloriam. Ernesti rejects the preposition- 'lhebest
authorities give it consuit note on p· 18, line 5.

44. Invlsa diis, i. e. if he said, in iliius potestate fortunam pesi-
tnm esse-Ingrata, ii he failed preterita meminisse, reliqua sperare.

60 2. Domi militiae. Soalso Klotz. Madvig, audothers‚militioe-
que. For quantaque Matthiae prefers quanta, since Cicero is not
speaking oi both the greatms oi Pompey's deeds and of hie good ior·
tune, hut only of the latter. Such a connection, however, oi themora
important with the less important, by means oi an explanatory con-
junctior, is not uucommoo. We might properly have expected, quna-
infelicitate tantae itte res, dic.

3. Ut = how-Assenseriat. In Cicero the active iorm oi this
word is very rare, except in the perfect tense and in the moods and
tenses derived srom the perfect. The deponent or middle form an·
swers to ite meaning more nearly than the active. ⁸

4. Obbempcrariut . . . . obedierint . . . . obsecundarint. Ob.
serve the propriety with which these words, which have the same
general signification, are selected and applied to their several subjecte
Obedirc denotes obedience as arr obligation, and a state oi duty and
subjection3 obsecundare and obtemperare, as au act oi free will. The
obtemperans obeys from persuasiorr, esteem, or sear, evinciug his con-
formity to another’swiii 3 the obsecundans from love and complaisance,
‘showing his readiness to obey. Ddd.—Tempestatesque. Tempestas
is a vocabulum medium, aud like valetudo, facinus, dolus, doc, taken
not only io malam, but also io bonam partem. 'l'he ‘⁶ favor’' oi the

N elementa was especially apparent in the piratical war.

6. Qut . . . . tacitus audcrct· P. ΟΣ 483 (2); Ζ. 556. On the
use oi tacitus, which may be rendered adverbiaily, see Ζ. 682.

10. Sicuti facitis. As evinced by the extraordinary honors aod
offices couicrred on him-Velle et optare. Velle means to visti, and
cooperate towards the reclination of one's wish; optare, to wish, aad
leave the realization oi one’s wish to others, or to sate3 expetere, to
wish, and apply to others for the realization oi one’s wish. Dbd.
