THE ORATION FOR M. MARCELLUS.

INTRODUCTION.

M. Catonius Marcamus had been a friend of Cicero’a from his earliest
youth ; their viewson political affairs had generally coincided‚ aad they con-
tinued to act in concert until the breaking out of the civil war. His merita
as an orator are said to have beon of a high order, and inferior to few except
Cicero himself. He is first mentioned as curule aedile with P. Clodius, a. u. c.
698. In February of that year he defended Milo, at Cicero’srequest, agairist
the charge of violence brought against him by Clodi us. ln 70⁰, he was one of
the six advocates who defended the cause of M. Scaurum aad after the death
of Clodius, 702, took a prominent part in the deience of Milo ln the year 703
he was consul with Ser. Sulpicius Rufus, and during the period of his magis·
tracy he showed himself a zealous partisan of Pompey, and sought tosecaro
his favor by urging the senate to extreme measures against Caesar.

But all the party zeal and animosity of Marcellus did not blind him to the ob
vicus imprudence of forcing on awar for which they were unprepared. Though
he joined Pompey aud his partisans in Epirus, it isclear that he did not engago
with any heartiness in the cause, of which, according to Cicero, he foreeaw
the failure from the beginning; and atter the battle of Pharsalia he aban-
doned all thoughts of prolonging the contest, andwithdrew to Mytilene, where
he gave himself up to the pursuits os rhetoric and philosophy. Here Caesar
was content to leave him unmolested in a lrind of honorable exile; and Mar·
cellus himself was unwilling to sue to the conqueror for forgivenes, though
Cicero wrote to him repeatedly from Rome, urging him in the strongest maa·
nerto do so, and assuring him of the clemancy of Cesar. But though Mar-
cellus himself would taire no sters to procuro his recall, his friends at Rome
were not backward in their exertions for that purpose ; aud at length, in afull
assembly of the senate, C. Marcellus, the cousin of the exile, threw himself at
Caesar’s feet to implore tho pardon of his hinsman, and his example was sol·
lowed by the whole body of the assembly. Caesar yielded to this demonstra·
tion of opinion, and M arcellus was declared to be forgiven, and restored to all
his former honore. Cicero wrote to announce to him this favorable result, in
a letter now lost; but the answer of Marcellus ispreserved, and is marked by
a singular coldness, which would lead us to the conclusion that his indiffer-
enca in this matter was real and not mmcd. He, however, set out on his
,retum but having touched at the Peiroeeus, where he had an interview with
his former colleague, Sulpicius, then proconsul in Graece, he was assassinated
immediately afterwards byone of his own attendants, P. Magius Chilo. There
seems no doubt that the daed was prompted by private resentment, though
suspected attho time to have been committed at the instigation of Caesar.
Sulpicius paid him all due funeral houors, aud caused him to be buried ιιι the
Academy, where a monument was erected to him by the Athenians, at the
public expense. -Droa Ga. ann Rou. Broo. aun Mrru.
