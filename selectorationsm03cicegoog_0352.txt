ᾖυεῑ in primis fait nobilio. Tusa. 3, 6, 12. S, who says that he
knows of no instance in any other writer-A. Liciniae. It was cus·
tomary for foreigners, on receiving the franchise, to take the praenomen
and nomen of the individual by whose favor they had received it.
Manutius supposes that Archim assumed the praenomen Aulus from
Marcus Lucullus, the brother of Lucius, whose praenomen, before bis
adoption by M. TerentiusVarro, he supposes to have been Aulus
The omission of his foreign name may be regarded as intentional. By
giving him his Roman name only, the orator recognises his rightful
claim to Romen citizenship.

t· Repetere prope anulare. Repetere :petere tanquam ribi
debitum. Archias has a right to claim that 1 should employ for his
good that which I have learned from him. Klotz: petere-Prope
auo jure. See note on p. 64, line 5. The prope softens the sao jure,
which would be an exaggerated statement. Others take it, less cor-

· rectly, with repetere. S. (in his second edition), who compares meo
jure quodammodo vindicare. De Off. l, 1, 2.

9. Memorlam reeordari. S. compares de Orat. 1, 2, 4: aa
mihi repetenda est veteris cujusdam memoria non sane ratis eapti-
eata recordatio, sed, dac-Ultimam = ab baa <etate remotissimam
The earliest recollection.

10. Inde usque repetens, se. rerum ordinem Repetere is used
absolutely in this way, de Orat. 1, 20, 91: neminem scriptorem artie
ne mediocriter quidem disertam suinae dicebat, qaum repeteret nsque
a Corace nereio quo et Tisia Tuae. 1, 48, 116: afara vero mortes
pro patria oppetita non solam gloriosa rhetoribus sed etiam beata
videri solent ,¹ repetant ab Erechthea-Inde aeque (irretllcr ἀρξάμενος) ’
marks a continuone progress from the distant point mentioued, quite
up to the moment present to the speaker. These words, according to
S, are found nowhere else in Cicero, and never in any other writer.
But, as he observes, there is no reason why they should not da—-He
thinlrs'it is an imitation of Isocrates's ἐντεῦθεν ἀρξάμενος, which M.
compares with it-Prinaipem = auctorem, magistrum-Saecipien-
dam . . . . ingrediendam. “ Suscipiendam pertinet ad canalium dis-
cendi artes dicendi; ingrediendam ad actum discendi. Illuc spectat
mox hortatu, huc praeoeptia.” Ernesti. S. compares the similar op-
position between suscipere and instituere ,· e. g. susceptarum reram
etjam institutarum. Ad Fam 5, 12, 2.

11. Rationem = viam, modum-Horam studiorum. Not elo·
quence only, but the studia hamanitatis in general. Cf. d 2.

12. ‘Hortatm This word occurs in the ablative only, in the
golden age. Tacitus has nominative plural non oon et marni hor-
tatae juvabant. Ann. l, 70, m. In Cicero it occurs but once more:
id feci aliorum coneilio, hortatu, auetoritate; ad Fam 13, 29, 7.
