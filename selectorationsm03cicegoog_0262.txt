Inimicum edictum With reference to the preceding note, thie may
mean an edict issued by the consuls, either of a geuerrd nature to pre·
scribe the mode of conducting business iu the senute; or to define the
mode of procedure in reference ιο a single session. Cicero calls it
inimicumne intended to trammel and thwart in his purpose the movet
of a measure, and declares that he will disregard it and persist in his
motion. In such u case nothing wes left to the consuls but to inter·
cede, when the praetor must yield. Cicero could be bold, because the
grounds of objectiou to Gabiniue's appoiutmeut, which existed under '
tbe Gabinien law, of which he was the morer, no longer existed un·

24. ilus, ecpneturm Emesti makes it the right which the tri-

bones had tohe appointed legates, und beneficium, the honorand rights
of the tribuneship iteelf. Benecke understands jue of the right of the
people generally ιο bestow its honors on whom it pleases, and benefi-
cium of the favor thereby conferred. Iu v. an rejects both of these
opinions, and understands the words of the right of the people to ap·
point Pompey to the command of the wer against the pirates As the
senate were opposed to this measure, they, iu revenge sor their defeat,
refused ιο confirm Gabinius as legate to Pompey. The overcoming
of this rerenge, therefore, by the appointment of Gabinius, will be a
triumph of the rights of the people.
