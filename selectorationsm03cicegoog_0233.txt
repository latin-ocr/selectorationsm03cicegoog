(el He seeks ιο show that to no other general than Pompey, who unita in him·
sellall the qualities of a commander, cau the command in this war he given
(ι 27); for (a) he possesses the most accurate knowledge and experience of
wer (d 28); (ι) the greatest brarery es shown in the Italian, Siciliae, Gallie,
and servile wass (ι 29, 80), and especially iu the war against the pirates (ι ³1-
3ο). lle besides possessas the greatest purity of character and disinterestedness
(ι 37-39) ; seli-command (ι io, tit ς good faith, courtesy, eloquence, and humau-
ity (ι 4ι); respect and authority among all nations, friends and foes (ι 434ο);
and finally, the marked favor of fortune everywhere atteuds him (ι st-it). lle
cau besides hest take charge of this wer as he is already iu the neighhorhood
ofit. (ι 50.)

The orator haring sufficientiy dwelt upon these points, proceeds ιο refute two
opposite opinions (ι ιι) :-

(l.) ‘l'hat of hortensius, who had objected that all power ought not ιο he con·
ferred upon one man Cicero weakens this ohjecnon hy showing that if the
conduct of the war against the pirates, in accordance with this view of Horten·
sius, had not been giren ιο rompay. the welfare cf the Roman people, nay,
even ita world supremacy would have been lost (ι ιι-ιι). lle thus gives ιο his
own opinion greater weight, and casu suspicion upon that of Hortensius, as
opposed ιο the weltere of the state. lle further adds, what does not properly
ferma part of this cause, that some had unworthily opposed Gabinius, in pre·
ventiug his appciutment as legate ιο Pompey, when he had been the proposes
of the Lex hy which Pompey was charged with the command of the war
againstthe pirates lt st, 58).

(2,) That of Catulus (to whom he testities his respect for his merita) that such a
proceeding was contrary ιο the institutions of their aucestcrs; hy showing, (ο)
that the Roman people, for its own advantage, had often made exceptione eud
put many wars in charge of one man (ι 0⁰); and (ι) that catrdus himself had
previously, ιο honor Pompey, voted for extraordinary measures. Praise of
Pompey (l dit-⁶2).

Fiually, cicero concludes with urgiug that, in accordance with the judgment of
the people, Pompey should he appointed ιο the command of the army against
Mithridates (ι ιι), especially because .he posseoees the seli-control which is ne·
cessary in an Asiatic war (ι di-et). lle theu offsets ιο the authority of ilor-
tensius and Catulus the views of other distinguished men who had supported
the Manilian hill (ι ds). At last, praise ci Manilius for his hill, encouragemeut ιο
perseverance, and, with the promise of his support, the most solemn assurauee
also thet the oratur has been indueuced solely hy the good of the state to de·
feud this hill aud cause (ι ιι-οοο).
