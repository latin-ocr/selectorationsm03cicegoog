32. Quos ex multorum annorum dissensione, &a The
quarrels alluded to ure those that arose imm the changes introduced
oi late years in the judicial departments ln s. u. e. 6³2, C. Gracchus
had deprived the senate ci their judicia! power, and transferred it to
the equitqs3 Sulla restored it to the senate in 6733 and L Cotta, in
684, had made another change (that would naturally satisly neither ’
the senate nor the knights), and confided it jointly to tho senate, the
equites, and the tribuni oerarii.-Though this arrangement had existed
for some years, yet Cicero speaks of tiis dayes the day that had
united the senate and the equites, because it was (we must assume)
the first day oi their eordial reconciliation; the commen danger having
made both senators aud knights cooperate zealcusly with Cicero
against Catilius. But differences hrohe out auew, particularly in
s. u. c. 693 and 694. See2 Ptine, 19.

³⁹· Tribunos aerarios· These were officere who assieted the
quaestors (from a. c. 49, the reddes) iu the management ol the treasnry.
Their principat duty was to collect each from his tribe the pay oi the
army. They were plebeiane. Madvig, Opusc. Ale. p. 242, seq, en·
deavcrs to show that there was no connection between the tribuni
cerarii oi an earlier dats, iu the sense above explained, and the tribuni
erarii os the Lea: Aurelia, who are here intended. His language is:
Gradum aliquem et distinctionem civium universorum certa aliqua
norma iactam, quemadmodum equites censu separabantur, illud nomen
tribunorum aerariorum notare debet. Hie view is that tha tribuni rera-
rii oi this period were those who possemed a property qualificatiou
next to that oi the equites, aud that they were so called in the law of
Cotta, from some resemblance in this respect to the earlier tribuni
aerarii, who, he supposes, were private men, whose property, oi a pre-
scribed amount, made them responsible lor the trust reposed in them.
The amount oi property required in either period isnot known-Scribas.
The scribae were public notaries, and received a aetery. From the ab
exspectatione sertis and the Scholiast, we learn that it was decided
by letto which magistrate each should be attached (“ Ipso die conue-
nerunt ad crarium scribae, nt sortirentur efficia, qni scriba esset
consulis, qni tribuni plebir”). ‘⁸ Iu Cicero’s time it seems that any
one might become a scriba or public cleris by purchase; and, eonse-
quently, as freedmcu and their sons were eligible, aud constituted a
great part oi the public clerks at Reme, the office was not highly es·
