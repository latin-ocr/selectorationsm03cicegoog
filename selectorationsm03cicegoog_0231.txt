THE ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW.

INTRODUCHON.

Mrrrrmosrns, king of Pontus, had been cheched in his plens of conquest and
aggrandizement, by L. Sulla, es early as s. u. ο. 669. hythe battlesof (36666-
neia and Orchomenos, and compelled to restrict himself to the dominicus
which he held before the commencement of the wera But he had from this
time improved every opportunity ιο carry into effect his long-cherished hopes.
Therefore, in the ysam 671 ιο 663, he had reuewed the war, and defeated the
Romen general, Murena, near Sinope. ln 666, while the Roman arms were
occupied in Spain with Sertorius, in Italy with Spartacus, while too the pirates
who infested the coasts of cilicie and Inseuria, increasing in boldness alter the
downfall of Carthage, caused marm along the sea and coasts of the Roman
empire, Mithridates thought the most favorable moment 666 arrived for carry·
ing his plens into execution, and directed his first affort to grasp Bithynia,
which, hythe will of lring Nicomedes, was ιο become a Roman province. ln
pursuit ofsimilar eims he sought to gain his son-in-law Tigranes, king of hr-
mania, and commenced a secret correspondence with Sertorius iu Spain, for
the purpose of bringing about some concert of action. The consuls of the year
666, L. Licinius Lucullus and Μ. Aurelius Cotta, marched against Mithridates
frorn Rome, and although Cotta lost a battle on land and see, Lucullus was
afterwards murcoemful on land, that he not only signally defeated Mithridates
insevere] bathea and drove him froin his kingdom, but also several times routed,
in the years 685 aud oso, Tigranes, who hed received and protected Mithridates
in his ssight. Thus Lucullus probably would heve completely frustreted the
last efforts of the combined lrings, if other circumstances, of which he was
partly the oeuse, hed not prevented. Lucullus 666 received his army in a
wretched end insubordinete condition, but 66 6 slrilful general he 666 brought
thern under subordination thus far by strict discipline, until his insatiable ava·
nce, which he sought to gretify et the expense of the legions, excited the
minds of thesoldiers against his severity. lt was thus easy for his enemies in
Rome, who, without his knowledge, had their agents aven in his army, to
foment insurrectione in hir legions, and in this wey so to paralyse his energy,
⁶ that Mithridates was enabled again toesteblish himself in Pontus. Thus his
opponents in Rome, at the heed of whom was Pompsy, succeeded in efl'ectiug
his recall from the command of the army, r. u. c. 667. He was succeeded by
Μ’. Acilius Glabrio, consul of this year, who, however, shewed such incapacity
eud so little activity, that Mitluidatesdisgracefully defeated two Roman le·
gates, Fabius and Triarius. At thesemo timealso the pirates from the coest
ol Cilicia arrd isauria, against whom Servilius isauricus, M. Antonius, and
Coecilius Metellus Creticus had fought, had made the most daring assaults

upon Roman territory end property, eud caused serious losses to the public
treesury as well as to private individuals. This state of things led the tribune,
Α. Gabinius, e friend of Pompsy, to propose a lew thet some one should be
clothed with extraordinery powers for three years for the purpose of putting
